/**
 *  The {@code KnuthShuffle} class provides a client for reading in a 
 *  sequence of strings and <em>shuffling</em> them using the Knuth (or Fisher-Yates)
 *  shuffling algorithm. This algorithm guarantees to rearrange the
 *  elements in uniformly random order, under
 *  the assumption that Math.random() generates independent and
 *  uniformly distributed numbers between 0 and 1.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation,
 *  see <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/11model">Section 1.1</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
 *  See {@link StdRandom} for versions that shuffle arrays and
 *  subarrays of objects, doubles, and ints.
