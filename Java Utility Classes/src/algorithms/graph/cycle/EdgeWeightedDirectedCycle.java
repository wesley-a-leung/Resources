/**
 *  The {@code EdgeWeightedDirectedCycle} class represents a data type for 
 *  determining whether an edge-weighted digraph has a directed cycle.
 *  The <em>hasCycle</em> operation determines whether the edge-weighted
 *  digraph has a directed cycle and, if so, the <em>cycle</em> operation
 *  returns one.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses depth-first search.
 *  The constructor takes time proportional to <em>V</em> + <em>E</em>
 *  (in the worst case),
 *  where <em>V</em> is the number of vertices and <em>E</em> is the number of edges.
 *  Afterwards, the <em>hasCycle</em> operation takes constant time;
 *  the <em>cycle</em> operation takes time proportional
 *  to the length of the cycle.
 *  <p>
 *  See {@link TopologicalOrder} to compute a topological order if the edge-weighted
 *  digraph is acyclic.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation,   
 *  see <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/44sp">Section 4.4</a> of   
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
