<h2>JConsole and JMX Remote Management</h2>
<ol>
<li><a name="win1" id="win1"><b>I run JConsole on Windows. Why does
the Local tab in Connect dialog not list any Java process?</b></a>
<p>The problem is most likely that your default Windows temporary
directory is on a FAT file system. If your TMP file system is NTFS
and JConsole does not show your processes, check your username as
described in <a href="#win2">FAQ #2</a>.</p>
<p>For security reasons, local monitoring and management is only
supported if your default Windows temporary directory is on a file
system that supports setting permissions on files and directories
(for example, on an NTFS file system). It is not supported on a FAT
file system that provide insufficient access controls.</p>
<p>A potential workaround for this issue:<br />
Set the TMP environment variable to refer to a directory on an NTFS
file system, or any file system that supports setting permissions
on files and directories before you run your application with local
or remote management enabled. Note that this file system should be
local to the machine. Setting this option for target applications
is application specific. To set this variable in a command prompt
or in a batch script, simply enter the following:</p>
<p>set TMP=<i>path</i></p>
<p>The environment variable can be set globally by adding it to the
list of environment variables in the System Properties (Control
Panel-&gt;System, select the "Advanced" tab and click on the
"Environment Variables" button). Through this interface, you can
choose to set the variable for all processes run by the current
user or globally as a system variable for all processes run by the
system.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="win2" id="win2"><b>JDK 5 jconsole and jps commands do
not work if your username contains '_' (underscore) on Windows.
JConsole is unable to find your Java processes.</b></a>
<p>It is a known problem in JDK 5 that jconsole and jps commands do
not work on Windows if your username contains '_' (underscore). Bug
<a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6301562">6301562</a> will
be fixed in a future release.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="win3" id="win3"><b>How to secure the password file on
Windows systems?</b></a>
<p>Please see the <a href="security-windows.html">"How to secure a
password file on Windows systems"</a> document for details.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="config1" id="config1"><b>JConsole fails to connect to
an application remotely or locally running on the same machine
using the Remote Tab. However, it works when connecting to it using
the Local Tab on the same machine.</b></a>
<p>It is most likely a configuration problem. First, make sure your
application was started with remote management enabled. (See
details from the <a href="agent.html">"Monitoring and Management
using JMX"</a> document.) Second, check if SSL is enabled in the
management properties to enable remote management and if it is
configured properly.</p>
<p>SSL is enabled by default when the remote management is enabled.
You can disable SSL by setting
<tt>com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl</tt> property to
<tt>false</tt>. If your application is not set up with SSL properly
but SSL is enabled for remote management, JConsole will fail to
connect to the application. Please see <a href=
"agent.html#gdemv">"Using SSL"</a> section in the "Monitoring and
Management Using JMX" document for information about using SSL for
remote management.</p>
<p>If the connection failure problem occurs only when your
application runs on <b>Linux</b>, please see <a href="#linux1">FAQ
#5</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="linux1" id="linux1"><b>I am having problem using
JConsole to connect to a JVM running on Linux. Connecting to JVM
running on Windows and Solaris works fine.</b></a>
<p>This is most likely a configuration problem on the Linux machine
or the management properties specified to run the application.
Please also see <a href="#config1">FAQ #a4</a> about using SSL.</p>
<p>You should check the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if the hostname correctly resolves to the host address.
<p>Run <tt>"hostname -i"</tt> command. If it reports 127.0.0.1,
JConsole would not be able to connect to the JVM running on that
Linux machine. To fix this issue, edit /etc/hosts so that the
hostname resolves to the host address.</p>
</li>
<li>Check if the Linux machine is configured to accept packets from
the host where JConsole runs on to connect to the application.
<p>Packet filtering is built in the Linux kernel. You can run
<tt>"/sbin/iptables --list"</tt> to determine if an external client
is allowed to connect to the JMX agent created for remote
management. You can use the following command to add a rule to
allow an external client such as JConsole to connect:</p>
<p><tt>/usr/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s <i>jconsole-host</i> -p tcp
--destination-port <i>jmxremote-port</i> -j ACCEPT</tt></p>
<p>where <i>jconsole-host</i> is either the hostname or the host
address on which JConsole runs on and <i>jmxremote-port</i> is the
port number set for <tt>com.sun.management.jmxremote.port</tt> for
remote management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a name="ssl1" id="ssl1"><b>My application has remote
management enabled with SSL. How to setup JConsole to connect to my
application?</b></a>
<p>When you enable the application for remote management with SSL,
you have set up a digital certificate on the system where the JMX
agent (MBean server) is running and configured SSL properly.</p>
<p>Assuming you created a keystore as described in the <a href=
"../security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#CreateKeystore">JSSE Guide</a>
and started your application (<tt>Server</tt>) as follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
% java -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=keystore \<br />  -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password Server<br />
</pre>
<p>To connect to this application, you need to run jconsole as
follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
% jconsole -J-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=truststore \<br />  -J-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=trustword<br />
</pre>
The above configuration authenticates the server only. If client
authentication is set up, you will need to provide a similar
keystore for the JConsole's keys, and an appropriate truststore for
the application.</li>
<li><a name="rmi1" id="rmi1"><b>Can I use JConsole to monitor an
application through a firewall?</b></a>
<p>The <tt>com.sun.management.jmxremote.port</tt> management
property specifies the port where the RMI Registry can be reached
but the ports where the <tt>RMIServer</tt> and
<tt>RMIConnection</tt> remote objects are exported is chosen by the
RMI stack. To export the remote objects (<tt>RMIServer</tt> and
<tt>RMIConnection</tt>) on a given port you need to create your own
RMI connector server programmatically, as described in the section
<i>Mimicking Out-of-the-Box Management Using the JMX Remote API</i>
in the <a href="agent.html#gdfvv">Java SE Monitoring and Management
Guide</a>. You must specify the <tt>JMXServiceURL</tt> as
follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
<tt>JMXServiceURL url = new
JMXServiceURL("service:jmx:rmi://localhost:" + <i>port1</i> +
"/jndi/rmi://localhost:" + <i>port2</i> +
"/jmxrmi");</tt>
</pre>
In the command above, <i>port1</i> is the port number on which the
<tt>RMIServer</tt> and <tt>RMIConnection</tt> remote objects are
exported and <i>port2</i> is the port number of the RMI
Registry.</li>

<h2>SNMP Based Management</h2>
<ol>
<li><a name="snmp1" id="snmp1"><b>Where can I find the standard MIB
for SNMP management of the Java virtual machine? What version of
SNMP protocol does it require?</b></a>

<p>The file <a href="../../../jre/api/management/JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB.mib"><code>JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB.mib</code></a> is the standard MIB for the Java virtual machine. Some objects exposed in the JVM MIB are 64-bit quantities. To see these objects, you need to use the SNMP v2 protocol. If you can walk the JVM MIB using SNMP v1 protocol, the 64-bit objects are skipped.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="snmp2" id="snmp2"><b>I'm not able to see all objects
the JVM MIB tree. For example, the jvmMemoryHeapUsed OID is
missing. Is it a known problem?</b></a>
<p>The JVM MIB includes 64-bit objects which require to use the
SNMP v2 protocol. All the 64-bit objects are skipped if you walk
the JVM MIB using SNMP v1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
