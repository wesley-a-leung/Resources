<h1>Java VisualVM - Connecting to JMX Agents Explicitly</h1>
<!-- ============ -->
<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<!-- ============ -->
<p>Java Management Extensions (JMX) technology can be used to
monitor and manage any Java technology-based applications (Java
applications) that are running in either a local or a remote Java
Virtual Machine (JVM). Java applications are automatically exposed
for monitoring and management by JMX agents if they are run on the
Java platform, Standard Edition (Java SE platform) version 6. If
the Java applications are running on the Java 2 platform, Standard
Edition (J2SE platform) 5.0, you can expose them manually for
monitoring and management by setting the <span class=
"style1">com.sun.management.jmxremote.*</span> system properties
when the applications are launched. Setting these system
properties, or running your applications on version 6 of the Java
SE platform, enables the platform's <em>out-of-the-box</em>
monitoring and management capability, automatically enabling the
platform MBean server in the JVM software, and registering MBeans
in it that expose the application for management by any
appropriately configured JMX client application. VisualVM is one
such JMX client application.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: For a very brief introduction to JMX
technology, MBeans, the platform MBean server, and how to monitor
and manage MBeans using Java VisualVM, see the <a href=
"http://visualvm.java.net/mbeans_tab.html">Java VisualVM MBeans
Tab</a> page. For an introduction to the Java SE platform's
out-of-the-box monitoring and management capability, see <a href="../management/agent.html">
<em>Monitoring and Management Using JMX Technology</em></a> in the
<a href="../management/toc.html">
Java SE Platform Monitoring and Management Guide</a>.</p>
<h2>When Are Explicit JMX Connections Necessary?</h2>
<p>As stated above, Java VisualVM will automatically detect and
connect to Java applications that are running on version 6 of the
Java SE platform or that have been started with the correct system
properties on version 5.0. However, because there are cases in
which Java VisualVM cannot automatically discover and connect to
JMX agents that are running in a target Java application, a means
of creating explicit JMX connections has also been added to Java
VisualVM.</p>
<p>The circumstances in which Java VisualVM will not automatically
discover JMX agents, and thus the Java applications they expose,
are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The target application is running on the J2SE 5.0 platform and
the&nbsp; <span class=
"style1">-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote*</span> properties have
not&nbsp; been specified.</li>
<li>The target application is running on the same host as Java
VisualVM but was started by a different user than the one who
started Java VisualVM. Java VisualVM discovers running applications
using the <tt>jps</tt> tool (<a href="../../tools/unix/jps.html">Solaris, Linux, or Mac OS X</a> or <a href="../../tools/windows/jps.html">Windows</a>), which can only discover Java
applications started by&nbsp; the same user as the one who starts
the Java VisualVM tool.</li>
<li>The target application is running on a remote host where <tt>jstatd</tt> 
(<a href="../../tools/unix/jstatd.html">Solaris, Linux, or Mac OS X</a> or <a href="../../tools/windows/jstatd.html">Windows</a>) is not running or is running but was
started by a different user. The <tt>jstatd</tt>
daemon provides an interface that allows remote monitoring
applications to connect to Java applications on the host where it
is running.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making an Explicit JMX Connection</h2>
<p>Before you can make an explicit JMX connection from Java
VisualVM to a running application, this application must be started
with the correct system properties. The system properties in
question are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>com.sun.management.jmxremote.port</code>, to specify the
port number through which the application will be exposed</li>
<li><code>com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl</code>, to specify
whether secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption will be activated to
secure the connection to the application</li>
<li><code>com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate</code>, to
specify whether the connection will be password protected</li>
</ul>
<h3>Local JMX Connections</h3>
<p>This section shows an example of how to connect Java VisualVM to
a local application via an explicit JMX connection.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start a Java application on the J2SE platform version 5.0,
setting the system properties to enable the Java SE platform's
out-of-the-box monitoring and management capability, using the
command shown below:
<pre>
java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3333 \
     -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \
     -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \
     <em>YourJavaApp</em>
</pre>
In the command above, <span class=
"style1"><em>YourJavaApp</em></span> is launched with the Java SE
platform's out-of-the-box monitoring and management capability
configured as follows:
<ul>
<li>The application is exposed for monitoring and management via
port 3333.</li>
<li>SSL encryption is deactivated.</li>
<li>Password authentication is deactivated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start Java VisualVM on the same machine.</li>
<li>In Java VisualVM's Applications window, right click on the
Local machine and select 'Add JMX Connection'.
<p><img src="images/add-jmx-local.png" alt=
"Adding a JMX connection to the local host." /></p>
</li>
<li>The Add JMX Connection dialog box opens.
<p><img src="images/add-jmx-connection-dialog.png" alt=
"The Add JMX Connection dialog." width="438" height="301" /></p>
<p>The host name <span class="style1">localhost</span> is already
filled in. You only need to add the port number on which the
application is exposed for monitoring and management.</p>
</li>
<li>Click OK. The JMX connection will appear in the application
tree, with a special JMX connection icon.
<p><img src="images/jmx-icon.png" alt=
"A JMX connection to the local host machine." width="285" height=
"191" /></p>
</li>
<li>Right click on the JMX connection, and select Open. The JVM
software exposed via the JMX connection can now be monitored and
managed via Java VisualVM.

"Monitoring an application via a JMX connection." width="607"
height="485" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Remote JMX Connections</h3>
<p>You can also make explicit JMX connections to applications
running on remote hosts, as explained below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click anywhere in the blank area under the application
tree and select Add JMX Connection.
<p><img src="images/add-jmx-remote.png" alt=
"Adding a JMX connection to a remote application." width="285"
height="247" /></p>
</li>
<li>Provide the machine name and port number for a running JMX
agent, that has been started with the appropriate system properties
to allow remote management. Here the JMX agent has been exposed on
port 2222 of the machine <span class="style1">curcuma</span>.
<p><img src="images/add-jmx-remote2.png" alt=
"Adding a remote JMX connection." width="439" height="300" /></p>
<p>If you know that the JMX agent has been protected with a
username and password, enter them in the Add JMX Connection dialog
and specify whether you want the credentials to be saved so<br />
that when Java VisualVM restarts it will silently reconnect to the
JMX agent without prompting the user for the security credentials
again.</p>
</li>
<li>If the JMX connection is secured and you did not provide a
username and password in the Add JMX Connection dialog, you will be
prompted to provide a username and password.
<p><img src="images/security-credentials.png" alt=
"JMX connector security credentials." width="405" height=
"167" /></p>
</li>
<li>If you know the correct username and password, the JMX
connection will be established, and the JMX connection will appear
in the application tree, with a special JMX connection icon.
<p><img src="images/remote-jmx-icon.png" alt=
"Remote JMX connection shown in application tree." width="285"
height="224" /></p>
</li>
<li>Right click on the remote JMX connection and select Open. You
can now monitor and manage remote applications via the JMX
connection, and manipulate any MBeans that are registered in the
MBean server exposed by this connection (note that the Java
VisualVM-MBeans plugin must be installed if you want to access to
the MBeans tab.)<br />

</li>
</ol>
