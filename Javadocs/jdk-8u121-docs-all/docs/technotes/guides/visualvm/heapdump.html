<h1>Java VisualVM - Browsing a Heap Dump</h1>
<!-- ============ -->
<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<!-- ============ -->
<p>You can use Java VisualVM to browse the contents of a heap dump
file and quickly see the allocated objects in the heap. Heap dumps
are displayed in the heap dump sub-tab in the main window. You can
open binary format heap dump files (<tt>.hprof</tt>) saved on your
local system or use Java VisualVM to take heap dumps of running
applications.</p>
<p>A heap dump is a snapshot of all the objects in the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) heap at a certain point in time. The JVM software
allocates memory for objects from the heap for all class instances
and arrays. The garbage collector reclaims the heap memory when an
object is no longer needed and there are no references to the
object. By examining the heap you can locate where objects are
created and find the references to those objects in the source. If
the JVM software is failing to remove unneeded objects from the
heap, Java VisualVM can help you locate the nearest garbage
collecting root for the object.</p>
<h2>Opening a Heap Dump File</h2>
<p>If you have a heap dump file saved on your local system, you can
open the file in Java VisualVM by choosing File &gt; Load from the
main menu. Java VisualVM can open heap dumps saved in the
<tt>.hprof</tt> file format. When you open a saved heap dump, the
heap dump opens as a tab in the main window.</p>
<h2>Taking a Heap Dump</h2>
<p>You can use Java VisualVM to take a heap dump of a local running
application. When you use Java VisualVM to take a heap dump, the
file is only temporary until you explicitly save it. If you do not
save the file, the file will be deleted when the application
terminates.</p>
<p>You can take a heap dump by doing either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the application in the Applications window and
choose Heap Dump.</li>
<li>Click Heap Dump in the Monitor tab of the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Heap dumps for a local application open as sub-tabs in the
application's tab. The heap dump also appears as a time-stamped
heap dump node under the application node in the Applications
window. To save a heap dump to your local system, right-click the
heap dump in the Applications window and choose Save As.</p>
<h2>Browsing a Heap Dump</h2>
<p>Java VisualVM enables you to visually browse heap dumps in the
following views:</p>
<h3>Summary View</h3>
<p>When you open a heap dump, Java VisualVM displays the Summary
view by default. The Summary view displays the running environment
where the heap dump was taken and other system properties.</p>

title="screenshot of Summary view of heap dump" />
<h3>Classes View</h3>
<p>The Classes view displays a list of classes and the number and
percentage of instances referenced by that class. You can view a
list of the instances of a specific class by right-clicking the
name and choosing Show in Instances View.</p>
<p>You can sort how results are displayed by clicking a column
heading. You can use the filter below the list to filter the
classes by name or limit the displayed results to sub-classes of a
class by right-clicking a class name and choosing Show Only
Subclasses.</p>

<h3>Instances View</h3>
<p>The Instance view displays object instances for a selected
class. When you select an instance from the Instance pane, Java
VisualVM displays the fields of that class and references to that
class in the respective panes. In the References pane, you can
right-click an item and choose Show Nearest GC Root to display the
nearest garbage collection root object.</p>
