<h1>Networking Release Notes</h1>
The following are known bugs and other networking issues for Java SE 1.4.2.
<ul>
<li>In releases prior to 1.4.2, it was possible to create an
invalid URL instance such as the following: <code>new URL
(&quot;http://www.example.com:-1/index.html&quot;)</code>.
Specifying a port number of <code>-1</code> is not valid. However,
in previous releases the <code>-1</code> was stripped off when
sending such URLS with HTTP commands. In 1.4.2, the <code>-1</code>
is left in the URL and this may cause problems for some HTTP
servers or proxies. Applications should not create URL instances
with a <code>-1</code> port number. Assuming the <code>-1</code>
refers to the default port in this example, the correct way to
create this URL is <code>new URL
(&quot;http://www.example.com/index.html&quot;)</code>. This note
only applies to the single argument URL constructor.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On Microsoft Windows 98/ME, a read timeout set using
<tt>Socket.setSoTimeout</tt> or an accept timeout set using
<tt>ServerSocket.setSoTimeout</tt> may result in a timeout that is
500ms later than expected. This issue is observable with all Java SE
releases and stems from a Microsoft Windows 98/ME bug. A patch for
Microsoft Windows 98/ME is obtainable through the following page on
the Microsoft website: <a href=
"http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q257821&amp;">
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q257821&amp;</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prior to Java SE 1.4.1 the
<tt>java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost()</tt> would cache the lookup
of the IP address of the local machine for the entire session of
the application. This behaviour poses a problem for applications
running on machines that are connected to the internet via a
dial-up connection or machines that acquired their addresses
through DHCP. This has been corrected in 1.4.1 so that the local IP
address is no longer cached. <tt>InetAddress.getLocalHost()</tt>
will return the correct IP address for dial-up connections as well
as for DHCP. See bug <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4211819">4211819</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prior to Java SE 1.4.1, the http/https protocol handlers would not
redirect correctly from a http URL to a https URL (and vice versa).
In particular, the redirect was attempted using the original URL
scheme. This has been fixed in 1.4.1. by returning the server
responses for such redirects (from http to https or https to http)
to the application. Therefore, it is the applications
responsibility to check the response code and recognize it as a
redirect. The Location header field value can be checked for the
redirect information, and then the application must decide whether
or not to follow the redirect using the new protocol. See bug
<a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4620571">4620571</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prior to Java SE 1.4 the <tt>java.net.URLConnection</tt> class
would handle errors from http servers inconsistently. In particular
the <tt>getInputStream</tt> or other methods would throw a
FileNotFoundException if the http server returned a response code
&gt;= 400 and the request was for a resource of a known file type.
<p>This has been corrected in 1.4 so that an IOException is thrown
for any http error from the server and a specific exception of
FileNotFoundExeption when the resource is not found (ie: 404 or 410
response codes). The exception is thrown irrespective of the file
type.</p>
<p>Applications that assumed an exception would not be thrown when
an http error is returned from the server need to be aware of this
change in 1.4 - see <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4160499">4160499</a>.</p>
<p>Related to this issue is that
<tt>HttpURLConnection.getErrorStream()</tt> method can now been
used to read the error page from the http server when a http error
is returned from the server. Previously <tt>getErrorStream()</tt>
always returned <tt>null</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prior to Java SE 1.4 the <tt>InetAddress.toString()</tt> would
perform a lookup via the name service if the hostname wasn't
previously resolved. This is no longer the case in 1.4 and
<tt>toString</tt> will return immediately. If the hostname is not
resolved the returned string will contain the dotted IP address
only.
<p>Applications that depend on <tt>toString()</tt> returning a
string with the resolved hostname should be aware of this
correction in 1.4 - see <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4239141">4239141</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prior to Java SE 1.4 if <tt>InetAddress.getByName</tt> if a lookup
to the name service failed then all subsequent lookups of that
hostname would fail for the lifetime of the virtual machine. This
arose because negative lookups were always cached. This has changed
in 1.4 so that by default if a lookup fails it's possible for a
subsequent lookup to succeed. This is particularly important in
dial-up environments or environments where the name service is not
reliable.
<p>Applications that depend on behaviour where subsequent lookups
always failed need to be aware of this issue - see <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4256129">4256129</a>. In
addition the caching of negative lookups can be controlled by the
<tt>networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl</tt> property in the
<tt>java.security</tt> file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Java SE 1.4 introduces a new exception <a href=
"../../../api/java/net/PortUnreachableException.html"><tt>java.net.PortUnreachableException</tt></a>.
This exception <em>may</em> be thrown by
<tt>DatagramSocket.send</tt> or <tt>DatagramSocket.receive</tt> if
the DatagramSocket is connected (via the connect method) and an
ICMP port unreachable is received to indicate that the remote
application is not running. The PortUnreachableException serves as
a useful indication for some UDP based protocols.
<p>The following lists the known issues with
PortUnreachableException:-</p>
<ol>
<li>On Solaris 8 if IPv6 is enabled then ICMP port unreachable
packets from IPv4 hosts will appear to be discarded. This is a
Solaris 8 bug and is tracked as bug 4422658.</li>
<li>On some Microsoft Windows releases (specifically Windows 98 and
Windows NT) ICMP port unreachable packets are incorrectly discarded
by the operating system and thus the PortUnreachableException is
not thrown. As this time we are not aware of any Windows Sockets
updates from Microsoft to fix this issue.</li>
<li>On Linux if UDP packets are sent to the loopback address and no
UDP applicatiob to bound to the destination port no ICMP port
unreachable indication is received and thus no
PortUnreachableException is thrown. This is a Linux kernel issue
and we are not aware of a patch at this time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On many Linux installations <tt>InetAddress.getLocalHost()</tt>
may return an InetAddress representing the loopback address
(127.0.0.1). This stems from many Linux installations configuring
/etc/hosts to map the hostname to the loopback address. If the host
has a static IP address then the <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> file should be
corrected to map the hostname to the host address.
<p>If DHCP is used in conjunction with dynamic DNS then there are
two options (i) change the name service search order in
<tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> to use dns before the hosts file (ie:
"hosts: dns files"), or (ii) configure InetAddress to use the DNS
name service provider instead of the default provider
(<tt>-Dsun.net.spi.nameservice.provider.1=dns,sun</tt>). This issue
is being tracked in <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4665037">4665037</a>.</p>
