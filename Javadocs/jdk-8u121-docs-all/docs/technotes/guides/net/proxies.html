<h1>Java Networking and Proxies</h1>
<h2>1) Introduction</h2>
<p>In today's networking environments, particularly corporate ones,
application developers have to deal with proxies almost as often as
system administrators. In some cases the application should use the
system default settings, in other cases it will we want to have a
very tight control over what goes through which proxy, and,
somewhere in the middle, most applications will be happy to
delegate the decision to their users by providing them with a GUI
to set the proxy settings, as is the case in most browsers.</p>
<p>In any case, a development platform, like Java, should provide
mechanisms to deal with these proxies that are both powerful and
flexible. Unfortunately, until recently, the Java platform wasn't
very flexible in that department. But all that changed in Java SE 5.0
as new API have been introduced to address this shortcoming, and
the purpose of this document is to provide an in-depth explanation of
all these APIs and mechanisms, the old ones, which are still valid,
as well as the new ones.</p>
<h2>2) System Properties</h2>
<p>Up until Java SE 1.4 system properties were the only way to set
proxy servers within the Java networking API for any of the
protocol handlers. To make matters more complicated, the names of
these properties have changed from one release to another and some
of them are now obsolete even if they are still supported for
compatibility's sake.</p>
<p>The major limitation of using system properties is that they are
an &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; switch. Meaning that once a proxy
has been set for a particular protocol, it will affect all
connections for that protocol. It's a VM wide behavior.</p>
<p>There are 2 main ways to set system properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a command line option when invoking the VM</li>
<li>Using the <code>System.setProperty(String, String)</code>
method, assuming, of course that you have permission to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's take a look, protocol by protocol, at the properties
you can use to set proxies. All proxies are defined by a host name
and a port number. The later is optional as, if it is not
specified, a standard default port will be used.</p>
<h3>2.1) HTTP</h3>
<p>There are 3 properties you can set to specify the proxy that
will be used by the http protocol handler:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>http.proxyHost</code>: the host name of the proxy
server</li>
<li><code>http.proxyPort</code>: the port number, the default value
being 80.</li>
<li><code>http.nonProxyHosts</code>:a list of hosts that should be
reached directly, bypassing the proxy. This is a list of patterns
separated by '|'. The patterns may start or end with a '*' for
wildcards. Any host matching one of these patterns will be reached
through a direct connection instead of through a proxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at a few examples assuming we're trying to execute
the main method of the GetURL class:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ java -Dhttp.proxyHost=webcache.example.com GetURL
</pre>
<p>All http connections will go through the proxy server at
<code>webcache.example.com</code> listening on port 80 (we didn't
specify any port, so the default one is used).</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ java -Dhttp.proxyHost=webcache.example.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080
-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=&rdquo;localhost|host.example.com&rdquo; GetURL
</pre>
<p>In that second example, the proxy server will still be at
<code>webcache.example.com</code>, but this time listening on port
8080. Also, the proxy won't be used when connecting to either
<code>localhost</code> or <code>host.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, these settings affect all http connections
during the entire lifetime of the VM invoked with these options.
However it is possible, using the System.setProperty() method, to
have a slightly more dynamic behavior.</p>
<p>Here is a code excerpt showing how this can be done:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
//Set the http proxy to webcache.example.com:8080

System.setProperty("http.proxyHost", "webcache.example.com");
System.setProperty("http.proxyPort", "8080");

// Next connection will be through proxy.
URL url = new URL("http://java.example.org/");
InputStream in = url.openStream();

// Now, let's 'unset' the proxy.
System.clearProperty("http.proxyHost");

// From now on http connections will be done directly.
</pre>
<p>This works reasonably well, but it
can get tricky if your application is multi-threaded. Remember,
system properties are &ldquo;VM wide&rdquo; settings, so all
threads are affected. Which means that the code in one thread
could, as a side effect, render the code in an other thread
inoperative.</p>
<h3>2.2) HTTPS</h3>
<p>The https (http over SSL) protocol handler has its own set of
properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>https.proxyHost</li>
<li>https.proxyPort</li>
</ul>
<p>As you probably guessed these work in the exact same manner as
their http counterparts, so we won't go into much detail except to
mention that the default port number, this time, is 443 and that
for the "non proxy hosts" list, the HTTPS protocol handler will use
the same as the http handler (i.e.
<code>http.nonProxyHosts</code>).</p>
<h3>2.3) FTP</h3>
<p>Settings for the FTP protocol handler follow the same rules as
for http, the only difference is that each property name is now
prefixed with '<code>ftp</code>.' instead of
'<code>http.</code>'</p>
<p>Therefore the system properties are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ftp.proxHost</code></li>
<li><code>ftp.proxyPort</code></li>
<li><code>ftp.nonProxyHosts</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, this time, there is a separate property for the "non
proxy hosts" list. Also, as for http, the default port number value
is 80. It should be noted that when going through a proxy, the FTP
protocol handler will actually use HTTP to issue commands to the
proxy server, which explains why this is the same default port
number.</p>
<p>Let's examine a quick example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ java -Dhttp.proxyHost=webcache.example.com
-Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -Dftp.proxyHost=webcache.example.com -Dftp.proxyPort=8080 GetURL
</pre>
<p>Here, both the HTTP and the FTP protocol handlers will use the
same proxy server at webcache.example.com:8080.</p>
<h3>2.4) SOCKS</h3>
<p>The SOCKS protocol, as defined in RFC 1928, provides a framework
for client server applications to safely traverse a firewall both
at the TCP and UDP level. In that sense it is a lot more generic
than higher level proxies (like HTTP or FTP specific proxies). Java SE
5.0 provides SOCKS support for client TCP sockets.</p>
<p>There are 2 system properties related to SOCKS:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>socksProxyHost</code> for the host name of the SOCKS
proxy server</li>
<li><code>socksProxyPort</code> for the port number, the default
value being 1080</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there is no dot ('.') after the prefix this time. This
is for historical reasons and to ensure backward compatibility.
Once a SOCKS proxy is specified in this manner, all TCP connections
will be attempted through the proxy.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ java -DsocksProxyHost=socks.example.com GetURL
</pre>
<p>Here, during the execution of the code, every outgoing TCP
socket will go through the SOCKS proxy server at
<code>socks.example.com:1080</code>.</p>
<p>Now, what happens when both a SOCKS proxy and a HTTP proxy are
defined? Well the rule is that settings for higher level protocols,
like HTTP or FTP, take precedence over SOCKS settings. So, in that
particular case, when establishing a HTTP connection, the SOCKS
proxy settings will be ignored and the HTTP proxy will be
contacted. Let's look at an example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ java -Dhttp.proxyHost=webcache.example.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080
-DsocksProxyHost=socks.example.com GetURL
</pre>
<p>Here, an http URL will go through
<code>webcache.example.com:8080</code> because the http settings
take precedence. But what about an ftp URL? Since no specific proxy
settings were assigned for FTP, and since FTP is on top of TCP,
then FTP connections will be attempted through the SOCKS proxy
server at <code>socks.example.com:1080</code>. If an FTP proxy
had been specified, then that proxy would have been used
instead.</p>
<h2>3) Proxy class</h2>
<p>As we have seen, the system properties are powerful, but not
flexible. The "all or nothing" behavior was justly deemed too
severe a limitation by most developers. That's why it was decided
to introduce a new, more flexible, API in Java SE 5.0 so that it would
be possible to have connection based proxy settings.</p>
<p>The core of this new API is the Proxy class which represents a
proxy definition, typically a type (http, socks) and a socket
address. There are, as of Java SE 5.0, 3 possible types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DIRECT</code> which represents a direct connection, or
absence of proxy.</li>
<li><code>HTTP</code> which represents a proxy using the HTTP
protocol.</li>
<li><code>SOCKS</code> which represents proxy using either SOCKS v4
or v5.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in order to create an HTTP proxy object you would call:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
SocketAddress addr = new
InetSocketAddress("webcache.example.com", 8080);
Proxy proxy = new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, addr);
</pre>
<p>Remember, this new proxy object represents a proxy
<b>definition</b>, nothing more. How do we use such an object? A
new <code>openConnection()</code> method has been added to the URL
class and takes a Proxy as an argument, it works the same way as
<code>openConnection()</code> with no arguments, except it forces
the connection to be established through the specified proxy,
ignoring all other settings, including the system properties
mentioned above.</p>
<p>So completing the previous example, we can now add:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
URL url = new URL("http://java.example.org/");
URLConnection conn = url.openConnection(proxy);
</pre>
<p>Simple, isn't it?</p>
<p>The same mechanism can be used to specify that a particular URL
has to be reached directly, because it's on the intranet for
example. That's where the DIRECT type comes into play. But, you
don't need to create a proxy instance with the DIRECT type, all you
have to do is use the NO_PROXY static member:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
URL url2 = new URL("http://infos.example.com/");
URLConnection conn2 = url2.openConnection(Proxy.NO_PROXY);
</pre>
<p>Now, this guarantees you that this specific URL will be
retrieved though a direct connection bypassing any other proxy
settings, which can be convenient.</p>
<p>Note that you can force a URLConnection to go through a SOCKS
proxy as well:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
SocketAddress addr = new InetSocketAddress("socks.example.com", 1080);
Proxy proxy = new Proxy(Proxy.Type.SOCKS, addr);
URL url = new URL("ftp://ftp.gnu.org/README");
URLConnection conn = url.openConnection(proxy);
</pre>
<p>That particular FTP connection will be attempted though the
specified SOCKS proxy. As you can see, it's pretty
straightforward.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, you can also specify a proxy for individual
TCP sockets by using the newly introduced socket constructor:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
SocketAddress addr = new InetSocketAddress("socks.example.com", 1080);
Proxy proxy = new Proxy(Proxy.Type.SOCKS, addr);
Socket socket = new Socket(proxy);
InetSocketAddress dest = new InetSocketAddress("server.example.org", 1234);
socket.connect(dest);
</pre>
<p>Here the socket will try to connect to its destination address
(server.example.org:1234) through the specified SOCKS proxy.</p>
<p>As for URLs, the same mechanism can be used to ensure that a
direct (i.e. not through any proxy) connection should be attempted
no matter what the global settings are:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Socket socket = new Socket(Proxy.NO_PROXY);<br />socket.connect(new InetAddress("localhost", 1234));
</pre>
<p>Note that this new constructor, as of Java SE 5.0, accepts only 2
types of proxy: SOCKS or DIRECT (i.e. the NO_PROXY instance).</p>
<h2>4) ProxySelector</h2>
<p>As you can see, with Java SE 5.0, the developer gains quite a bit
of control and flexibility when it comes to proxies. Still, there
are situations where one would like to decide which proxy to use
dynamically, for instance to do some load balancing between
proxies, or depending on the destination, in which case the API
described so far would be quite cumbersome. That's where the
ProxySelector comes into play.</p>
<p>In a nutshell the ProxySelector is a piece of code that will
tell the protocol handlers which proxy to use, if any, for any
given URL. For example, consider the following code:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
URL url = new URL("http://java.example.org/index.html");
URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
InputStream in = conn.getInputStream();
</pre>
<p>At that point the HTTP protocol handler is invoked and it will
query the proxySelector. The dialog might go something like
that:</p>
<b>Handler</b>: Hey dude, I'm trying to reach java.example.org,
should I use a proxy?<br />
<b>ProxySelector</b>: Which protocol do you intend to use?<br />
<b>Handler</b>: http, of course!<br />
<b>ProxySelector</b>: On the default port?<br />
<b>Handler</b>: Let me check.... Yes, default port.<br />
<b>ProxySelector</b>: I see. Then you shall use
webcache.example.com on port 8080 as a proxy.<br />
<b>Handler</b>: Thanks. &lt;pause&gt; Dude,
webcache.example.com:8080 doesn't seem to be responding! Any other
option?<br />
<b>ProxySelector</b>: Dang! OK, try webcache2.example.com, on port
8080 as well.<br />
<b>Handler</b>: Sure. Seems to be working. Thanks.<br />
<b>ProxySelector</b>: No sweat. Bye.
<p>Of course I'm embellishing a bit, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>The best thing about the ProxySelector is that it is plugable!
Which means that if you have needs that are not covered by the
default one, you can write a replacement for it and plug it in!</p>
<p>So what is a ProxySelector? Let's take a look at the class
definition:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
public abstract class ProxySelector {
        public static ProxySelector getDefault();
        public static void setDefault(ProxySelector ps);
        public abstract List&lt;Proxy&gt; select(URI uri);
        public abstract void connectFailed(URI uri,
                SocketAddress sa, IOException ioe);
}
</pre>
<p>As we can see, ProxySelector is an abstract class with 2 static
methods to set, or get, the default implementation, and 2 instance
methods that will be used by the protocol handlers to determine
which proxy to use or to notify that a proxy seems to be
unreachable. If you want to provide your own ProxySelector, all you
have to do is extend this class, provide an implementation for
these 2 instance methods then call ProxySelector.setDefault()
passing an instance of your new class as an argument. At this point
the protocol handlers, like http or ftp, will query the new
ProxySelector when trying to decide what proxy to use.</p>
<p>Before we see in details how to write such a ProxySelector,
let's talk about the default one. Java SE 5.0 provides a default
implementation which enforces backward compatibility. In other
terms, the default ProxySelector will check the system properties
described earlier to determine which proxy to use. However, there
is a new, optional feature: On recent Windows systems and on Gnome
2.x platforms it is possible to tell the default ProxySelector to
use the system proxy settings (both recent versions of Windows and
Gnome 2.x let you set proxies globally through their user
interface). If the system property
<code>java.net.useSystemProxies</code> is set to true (by default
it is set to false for compatibility sake), then the default
ProxySelector will try to use these settings. You can set that
system property on the command line, or you can edit the JRE
installation file <code>lib/net.properties</code>, that way you
have to change it only once on a given system.</p>
<p>Now let's examine how to write, and install, a new
ProxySelector.</p>
<p>Here is what we want to achieve: We're pretty happy with the
default ProxySelector behavior, except when it comes to http and
https. On our network we have more than one possible proxy for
these protocols and we'd like our application to try them in
sequence (i.e.: if the first one doesn't respond, then try
the second one and so on). Even more, if one of them fails too many
time, we'll remove it from the list in order to optimize things a
bit.</p>
<p>All we need to do is subclass
<code>java.net.ProxySelector</code> and provide implementations for
both the <code>select()</code> and <code>connectFailed()</code>
methods.</p>
<p>The <code>select()</code> method is called by the protocol
handlers before trying to connect to a destination. The argument
passed is a URI describing the resource (protocol, host and port
number). The method will then return a List of Proxies. For
instance the following code:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
URL url = new URL("http://java.example.org/index.html");
InputStream in = url.openStream();
</pre>
<p>will trigger the following pseudo-call in the protocol
handler:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
List&lt;Proxy&gt; l = ProxySelector.getDefault().select(new URI("http://java.example.org/"));
</pre>
<p>In our implementation, all we'll have to do is check that the
protocol from the URI is indeed http (or https), in which case we
will return the list of proxies, otherwise we just delegate to the
default one. To do that, we'll need, in the constructor, to store a
reference to the old default, because ours will become the
default.</p>
<p>So it is starting to look like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
public class MyProxySelector extends ProxySelector {
        ProxySelector defsel = null;
        MyProxySelector(ProxySelector def) {
                defsel = def;
        }
        
        public java.util.List&lt;Proxy&gt; select(URI uri) {
                if (uri == null) {
                        throw new IllegalArgumentException("URI can't be null.");
                }
                String protocol = uri.getScheme();
                if ("http".equalsIgnoreCase(protocol) ||
                        "https".equalsIgnoreCase(protocol)) {
                        ArrayList&lt;Proxy&gt; l = new ArrayList&lt;Proxy&gt;();
                        // Populate the ArrayList with proxies
                        return l;
                }
                if (defsel != null) {
                        return defsel.select(uri);
                } else {
                        ArrayList&lt;Proxy&gt; l = new ArrayList&lt;Proxy&gt;();
                        l.add(Proxy.NO_PROXY);
                        return l;
                }
        }
}
</pre>
<p>First note the constructor that keeps a reference to the old
default selector. Second, notice the check for illegal argument in
the select() method in order to respect the specifications.
Finally, notice how the code defers to the old default, if there
was one, when necessary. Of course, in this example, I didn't
detail how to populate the ArrayList, as it not of particular
interest, but the complete code is available in the appendix if
you're curious.</p>
<p>As it is, the class is incomplete since we didn't provide an
implementation for the <code>connectFailed()</code> method. That's
our very next step.</p>
<p>The <code>connectFailed()</code> method is called by the
protocol handler whenever it failed to connect to one of the
proxies returned by the <code>select()</code> method. 3 arguments
are passed: the URI the handler was trying to reach, which should
be the one used when <code>select()</code> was called, the
<code>SocketAddress</code> of the proxy that the handler was trying
to contact and the IOException that was thrown when trying to
connect to the proxy. With that information, we'll just do the
following: If the proxy is in our list, and it failed 3 times or
more, we'll just remove it from our list, making sure it won't be
used again in the future. So the code is now:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
public void connectFailed(URI uri, SocketAddress sa, IOException ioe) {
        if (uri == null || sa == null || ioe == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Arguments can't be null.");
        }
        InnerProxy p = proxies.get(sa); 
        if (p != null) {
                if (p.failed() &gt;= 3)
                   proxies.remove(sa);
        } else {
                if (defsel != null)
                    defsel.connectFailed(uri, sa, ioe);
        }
}
</pre>
<p>Pretty straightforward isn't it. Again we have to check the
validity of the arguments (specifications again). The only thing we
do take into account here is the SocketAddress, if it's one of the
proxies in our list, then we do deal with it, otherwise we defer,
again, to the default selector.</p>
<p>Now that our implementation is, mostly, complete, all we have to
do in the application is to register it and we're done:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyProxySelector ps = new MyProxySelector(ProxySelector.getDefault());
        ProxySelector.setDefault(ps);
        // rest of the application
}
</pre>
<p>Of course, I simplified things a bit for the sake of clarity, in
particular you've probably noticed I didn't do much Exception
catching, but I'm confident you can fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>It should be noted that both Java Plugin and Java Webstart do
replace the default ProxySelector with a custom one to integrate
better with the underlying platform or container (like the web
browser). So keep in mind, when dealing with ProxySelector, that
the default one is typically specific to the underlying platform
and to the JVM implementation. That's why it is a good idea, when
providing a custom one, to keep a reference to the older one, as
we've done in the above example, and use it when necessary.</p>
<h2>5) Conclusion</h2>
<p>As we have now established Java SE 5.0 provides quite a number of
ways to deal with proxies. From the very simple (using the system
proxy settings) to the very flexible (changing the ProxySelector,
albeit for experienced developers only), including the per
connection selection courtesy of the Proxy class.</p>
