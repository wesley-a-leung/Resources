<h1>Persistent Connections</h1>
<h2>What is HTTP Persistent Connections?</h2>
<p>HTTP persistent connections, also called HTTP keep-alive, or
HTTP connection reuse, is the idea of using the same TCP connection
to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to
opening a new one for every single request/response pair. Using
persistent connections is very important for improving HTTP
performance.</p>
<p>There are several advantages of using persistent connections,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network friendly. Less network traffic due to fewer setting up
and tearing down of TCP connections.</li>
<li>Reduced latency on subsequent request. Due to avoidance of
initial TCP handshake</li>
<li>Long lasting connections allowing TCP sufficient time to
determine the congestion state of the network, thus to react
appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantages are even more obvious with HTTPS or HTTP over
SSL/TLS. There, persistent connections may reduce the number of
costly SSL/TLS handshake to establish security associations, in
addition to the initial TCP connection set up.</p>
<p>In HTTP/1.1, persistent connections are the default behavior of
any connection. That is, unless otherwise indicated, the client
SHOULD assume that the server will maintain a persistent
connection, even after error responses from the server. However,
the protocol provides means for a client and a server to signal the
closing of a TCP connection.</p>
<h2>What makes a connection reusable?</h2>
<p>Since TCP by its nature is a stream based protocol, in order to
reuse an existing connection, the HTTP protocol has to have a way
to indicate the end of the previous response and the beginning of
the next one. Thus, it is required that all messages on the
connection MUST have a self-defined message length (i.e., one not
defined by closure of the connection). Self demarcation is achieved
by either setting the Content-Length header, or in the case of
chunked transfer encoded entity body, each chunk starts with a
size, and the response body ends with a special last chunk.</p>
<h2>What happens if there are proxy servers in between?</h2>
<p>Since persistent connections applies to only one transport link,
it is important that proxy servers correctly signal
persistent/or-non-persistent connections separately with its
clients and the origin servers (or to other proxy servers). From a
HTTP client or server's perspective, as far as persistence
connection is concerned, the presence or absence of proxy servers
is transparent.</p>
<h2>What does the current JDK do for Keep-Alive?</h2>
<p>The JDK supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 persistent
connections.</p>
<p>When the application finishes reading the response body or when
the application calls close() on the <code>InputStream</code>
returned by <code>URLConnection.getInputStream()</code>, the JDK's
HTTP protocol handler will try to clean up the connection and if
successful, put the connection into a connection cache for reuse by
future HTTP requests.</p>
<p>The support for HTTP keep-Alive is done transparently. However,
it can be controlled by system properties
<code>http.keepAlive</code>, and <code>http.maxConnections</code>,
as well as by HTTP/1.1 specified request and response headers.</p>
<p>The system properties that control the behavior of Keep-Alive
are:</p>
<p><code>http.keepAlive=&lt;boolean&gt;<br />
default: true</code></p>
<p>Indicates if keep alive (persistent) connections should be
supported.</p>
<p><code>http.maxConnections=&lt;int&gt;<br />
default: 5</code></p>
<p>Indicates the maximum number of connections per destination to
be kept alive at any given time</p>
<p>HTTP header that influences connection persistence is:</p>
<p><code>Connection: close</code></p>
<p>If the "Connection" header is specified with the value "close"
in either the request or the response header fields, it indicates
that the connection <u>should not</u> be considered 'persistent'
after the current request/response is complete.</p>
<p>The current implementation doesn't buffer the response body.
Which means that the application has to finish reading the response
body or call close() to abandon the rest of the response body, in
order for that connection to be reused. Furthermore, current
implementation will not try block-reading when cleaning up the
connection, meaning if the whole response body is not available,
the connection will not be reused.</p>
<h2>What's new in JDK 5<!--Tiger-->?</h2>
<p>When the application encounters a HTTP 400 or 500 response, it
may ignore the <code>IOException</code> and then may issue another
HTTP request. In this case, the underlying TCP connection won't be
Kept-Alive because the response body is still there to be consumed,
so the socket connection is not cleared, therefore not available
for reuse. What the application needs to do is call
<code>HttpURLConnection.getErrorStream()</code> after catching the
<code>IOException</code> , read the response body, then close the
stream. However, some existing applications are not doing this. As
a result, they do not benefit from persistent connections. To
address this problem, we have introduced a workaround.</p>
<p>The workaround involves buffering the response body if the
response is &gt;=400, up to a certain amount and within a time
limit, thus freeing up the underlying socket connection for reuse.
The rationale behind this is that when the server responds with a
&gt;=400 error (client error or server error. One example is
&quot;404: File Not Found&quot; error), the server usually sends a
small response body to explain whom to contact and what to do to
recover.</p>
<p>Several new <!--Sun-->Oracle JDK implementation specific properties are
introduced to help clean up the connections after error response
from the server.</p>
<p>The major one is:</p>
<p>
<code>sun.net.http.errorstream.enableBuffering=&lt;boolean&gt;</code><br />

<code>default: false</code></p>
<p>With the above system property set to true (default is false),
when the response code is &gt;=400, the HTTP handler will try to
buffer the response body. Thus freeing up the underlying socket
connection for reuse. Thus, even if the application doesn't call
<code>getErrorStream()</code>, read the response body, and then
call close(), the underlying socket connection may still be
kept-alive and reused.</p>
<p>The following two system properties provide further control to
the error stream buffering behavior:</p>
<p><code>sun.net.http.errorstream.timeout=&lt;int&gt; in
millisecond<br />
default: 300 millisecond</code></p>
<p><code>sun.net.http.errorstream.bufferSize=&lt;int&gt; in
bytes<br />
default: 4096 bytes</code></p>
<h2>What can you do to help with Keep-Alive?</h2>
<p>Do not abandon a connection by ignoring the response body. Doing
so may results in idle TCP connections. That needs to be garbage
collected when they are no longer referenced.</p>
<p>If <code>getInputStream()</code> successfully returns, read the
entire response body.</p>
<p>When calling <code>getInputStream()</code> from
<code>HttpURLConnection</code>, if an <code>IOException</code>
occurs, catch the exception and call <code>getErrorStream()</code>
to get the response body (if there is any).</p>
<p>Reading the response body cleans up the connection even if you
are not interested in the response content itself. But if the
response body is long and you are not interested in the rest of it
after seeing the beginning, you can close the InputStream. But you
need to be aware that more data could be on its way. Thus the
connection may not be cleared for reuse.</p>
<p>Here's a code example that complies to the above
recommendation:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
try {
        URL a = new URL(args[0]);
        URLConnection urlc = a.openConnection();
        is = conn.getInputStream();
        int ret = 0;
        while ((ret = is.read(buf)) &gt; 0) {
          processBuf(buf);
        }
        // close the inputstream
        is.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
        try {
                respCode = ((HttpURLConnection)conn).getResponseCode();
                es = ((HttpURLConnection)conn).getErrorStream();
                int ret = 0;
                // read the response body
                while ((ret = es.read(buf)) &gt; 0) {
                        processBuf(buf);
                }
                // close the errorstream
                es.close();
        } catch(IOException ex) {
                // deal with the exception
        }
}
</pre>
<p>If you know ahead of time that you won't be interested in the
response body, you should issue a HEAD request instead of a GET
request. For example when you are only interested in the meta info
of the web resource or when testing for its validity, accessibility
and recent modification. Here's a code snippet:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
URL a = new URL(args[0]);
URLConnection urlc = a.openConnection();
HttpURLConnection httpc = (HttpURLConnection)urlc;
// only interested in the length of the resource
httpc.setRequestMethod(&quot;HEAD&quot;);
int len = httpc.getContentLength();
</pre>
<h2>Changes in <!--Java SE-->JDK 6</h2>
Prior to <!--Java SE-->JDK 6, if an application closes a HTTP InputStream
when more than a small amount of data remains to be read, then the
connection had to be closed, rather than being cached. Now in <!--Java
SE-->JDK 6, the behavior is to read up to 512 Kbytes off the connection
in a background thread, thus allowing the connection to be reused.
The exact amount of data which may be read is configurable through
the <code>http.KeepAlive.remainingData</code> system property.
