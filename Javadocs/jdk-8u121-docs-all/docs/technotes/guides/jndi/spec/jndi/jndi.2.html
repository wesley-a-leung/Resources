Goals and Design Principles</h2>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_997858" id="pgfId_997858"></a>We
followed several principles and maxims in designing the API.</p>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_997859" id=
"pgfId_997859"></a>2.1 Keep it consistent and intuitive</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_997860" id=
"pgfId_997860"></a>Wherever possible, we have used existing
components from the rest of the Java development environment.
Adhering to this principle not only makes JNDI consistent with
existing core classes in the Java platform but also reduces
needless proliferation of classes.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_997862" id="pgfId_997862"></a>The
object-oriented nature of the Java programming language allows for
an intuitive and simple API design, in which the directory service
functionality is expressed as a natural extension to the more
fundamental naming service functionality.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_997863" id=
"pgfId_997863"></a>2.2 Pay for what you use</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_997864" id="pgfId_997864"></a>The
API is structured in a tiered manner so that the application
programmer interested in a certain directory service capability
need not necessarily know about a more advanced capability. We have
strived to keep the lower tiers simple and also make them represent
the common case capability, relegating the more complex ones to the
upper tiers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_997865" id=
"pgfId_997865"></a>2.3 Implementable over common directory and
naming services and protocols</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_997866" id="pgfId_997866"></a>This
goal is important for two reasons. First, it enables Java
applications to take advantage of information in a variety of
existing naming and directory services such as DNS, NDS, NIS (YP),
X.500, and LDAP. Second, it helps limit the appearance of any
implementation specific artifacts in the API.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_997867" id=
"pgfId_997867"></a>Providing a unified interface to multiple naming
and directory services does not imply that access of unique
features of a particular service is precluded. The unified API
which is designed to cover the common case is still beneficial to
applications that have explicit knowledge of the underlying naming
or directory service. Such applications still benefit from sharing
the common portions that use the API. This is analogous to
applications sharing commonly used classes and yet adding needed
specificity via subclassing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_997868" id=
"pgfId_997868"></a>2.4 Seamless integration</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_997869" id="pgfId_997869"></a>This
is important not only because of the diversity of directory service
and naming services in the installed base that need to be
supported, but also because new Java application and service
programmers can export their own namespaces and directory objects
in a uniform way.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_997870" id="pgfId_997870"></a>We
also wanted to make a variety of implementation choices possible
without having the application pay for this freedom. For example, a
&quot;thin-client&quot; might be better served by a proxy-style
protocol in which the access to specific naming and directory
services is relegated to a server. Whereas, a performance
sensitive, resource rich client, might choose to use an
implementation which directly allows it to access the various
servers. However, the application should be insulated from these
implementation choices. It should be possible to defer such choices
even until runtime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998702" id=
"pgfId_998702"></a>2.5 Support for leading industry standards</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998703" id="pgfId_998703"></a>The
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (Internet RFC 2251) has
emerged as the standard for directory access at the protocol level.
All major directory vendors have products that support this
protocol. An application that uses JNDI should be able to access
all of the features offered by this standard. Where possible, JNDI
should support conventions (such as those for specifying search
queries/filters) already defined by the standard.</p>
