Security Considerations</h2>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998460" id="pgfId_998460"></a>There
are two main settings in which JNDI is used: with and without a
security manager installed.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998461" id="pgfId_998461"></a>In the
case of Java applications running with no security manager
installed, the code is trusted and the application can access
service providers from the local classpath. Furthermore, there is
no restriction if the service providers access local files, or make
network connections to naming or directory servers anywhere on the
network.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_1002110" id="pgfId_1002110"></a>In
the case of an applet or application running with a security
manager installed, there can be trusted code and untrusted code
within the same applet or application. The <em>Sharing Context
Handles</em> and <em>Context Environment</em> sections below are
especially applicable in such a scenario. The ability of an applet
or an application running with a security manager installed to
access service providers, especially service providers that require
the use of restricted resources (like the file system or network
connections) may be severely limited.</p>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998464" id=
"pgfId_998464"></a>8.1 JNDI Classes</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998465" id="pgfId_998465"></a>The
classes in the JNDI packages contain no native methods. They do not
require any special installation in order to run inside an applet
or an application.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998466" id="pgfId_998466"></a>JNDI
uses several system properties (see <a href="jndi.6.html#a21515"
class="XRef">Application/Applet-scope Standard JNDI Properties</a>
). This allows applets and applications to be configured easily
without much programming. However, an applet or application might
have restricted access to some or all system properties as a result
of the security manager installed on the platform on which it is
running. Consequently, JNDI also allows these same properties to be
specified as applet parameters, in resource files, or as
environment properties passed to a context.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998467" id="pgfId_998467"></a>In the
Java Platform, the JNDI classes use <code>doPrivileged</code>
blocks when accessing the system properties listed in <a href=
"jndi.6.html#a21515" class="XRef">Application/Applet-scope Standard
JNDI Properties</a> .</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998468" id=
"pgfId_998468"></a>8.2 Security Model</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998469" id="pgfId_998469"></a>JNDI
does not define a security model or a common security interface for
accessing naming and directory servers. Security-related
operations, such as those required for authentication or access
control to the directory service, are dealt with by individual
service providers. JNDI provides the means by which an application
or applet can pass such security-related information to service
providers in order to establish a connection with the service, but
does not itself take part in such security-related activities.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998470" id="pgfId_998470"></a>JNDI
also provides the means by which security-related problems can be
indicated to the client in the form of security-related
exceptions.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998471" id="pgfId_998471"></a>JNDI
service providers are controlled by the security manager in place
when they try to gain access to protected resources such as the
file system or network. Some service providers may control
directory access by making use of the Java Platform security
architecture (for example, allowing access to special ports for
administration-related applets).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998472" id=
"pgfId_998472"></a>8.3 Access To Servers</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998473" id="pgfId_998473"></a>Naming
and directory services typically have their own security system in
place to protect information stored therein. For example, one
directory might require that its users first &quot;login&quot; to
the directory before reading or updating information in the
directory. Some services might allow anonymous access to part of
its namespace/directory.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998474" id="pgfId_998474"></a>Once a
user has logged into a service, it is imperative for security
reasons not to share that privilege with untrusted code.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998475" id=
"pgfId_998475"></a>8.4 Sharing Context Handles</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998476" id="pgfId_998476"></a>In the
following discussion, we refer to a <em>context handle</em> as a
reference to a <code>Context</code> instance. This is analogous to
how a reference to a <code>Reader</code> / <code>Writer</code> /
<code>InputStream</code> / <code>OutputStream</code> instance is
often referred to as a <em>file handle</em> .</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998477" id="pgfId_998477"></a>A
context handle should be treated like any other protected resource.
If a piece of trusted code obtains a context handle (possibly by
authenticating its access with the directory server), it should
protect the use of that context against unauthorized or untrusted
code. This is analogous to how application and/or applet code
should protect file handles. For example, if a piece of trusted
code opens a file for writing (and it was granted such privilege
because of its trusted nature), it should be careful about passing
that file handle to any other pieces of code, trusted or
otherwise.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998478" id=
"pgfId_998478"></a>Similarly, giving access of a context handle to
untrusted code may lead to its misuse in accessing or updating
information in the directory, or accessing security-sensitive
environment properties associated with the context.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998480" id=
"pgfId_998480"></a>8.5 <a name="a31601"></a>Context Environment</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998481" id="pgfId_998481"></a>JNDI
allows the application/applet to pass preferences and information
to a context in the form of an environment. The application/applet
can also get the current environment from a context. See <a href=
"jndi.6.html#a30460" class="XRef">Configuration</a> and Appendix
A for more information on a context's environment.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998482" id="pgfId_998482"></a>The
nature of the information contained in a context's environment
might be sensitive and need protection from untrusted access.
Specifically, the environment properties
<code>java.naming.security.principal</code> and
<code>java.naming.security.credentials</code> contain information
that should not be given out to untrusted code. Service providers
might take precaution to protect against accessing these properties
(see <em>Responsibilities of Service Providers</em> below). Client
applications and applets should take care not to pass context
handles with such sensitive environment properties to untrusted
code.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998483" id=
"pgfId_998483"></a>8.6 Class Loading</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998484" id="pgfId_998484"></a>JNDI
allows the class files to be loaded dynamically.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_1001332" id="pgfId_1001332"></a>When
JNDI is run on the Java platform, it will attempt to load such
classes from the locations specified in the codebase using the
<code>java.net.URLClassLoader</code> . In order for the class
loading to succeed, you must grant the application and the JNDI and
service provider classes the permissions appropriate for the URLs
named in the codebase. For example, if the URL scheme is
&quot;http&quot; or &quot;ftp&quot;, you must grant the application
the appropriate <code>java.net.SocketPermission</code> ; if the URL
scheme is &quot;file&quot;, you must grant the application the
appropriate <code>java.io.FilePermission</code> .</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998485" id=
"pgfId_998485"></a>8.7 Serializable Objects</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998486" id=
"pgfId_998486"></a>Several of the JNDI classes are serializable.
This allows the objects to be accessed in the form of a byte
stream, possibly outside of the environment in which they were
created.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998488" id=
"pgfId_998488"></a>8.8 Responsibilities of Service Providers</h3>
<div>
<h4 class="subsection"><a name="pgfId_998489" id=
"pgfId_998489"></a>8.8.1 Context Environment</h4>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998490" id="pgfId_998490"></a>When a
context handle is created (either by getting the initial context or
by looking it up or by creating it from the directory), some
environment properties may be specified for it. Sometimes
security-related properties are required for the creation of the
context handle (such as user information that &quot;logs&quot; the
user in with the directory). The service provider should take care
to protect this security-sensitive information from untrusted
code.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998491" id="pgfId_998491"></a>The
service provider needs to protect the context's environment from
being tampered or otherwise modified by untrusted code. The service
provider needs to protect the security-sensitive environment
properties from being read by untrusted code. It might do this by
disallowing any thread whose execution context and/or trust level
is different than that originally held by the thread that created
the context handle to use the context handle. Or it might disallow
certain operations (such as accessing security-sensitive
environment properties). Or it might simply not return
security-sensitive environment properties, or only return them to
trusted code.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 class="subsection"><a name="pgfId_998492" id=
"pgfId_998492"></a>8.8.2 Network Security</h4>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998493" id=
"pgfId_998493"></a>Untrusted code (such as those found in untrusted
applets) have limited access to the network. Untrusted applets, for
example, can only create a network connection to the host from
which they were downloaded. With finer-grain security models, it
will be possible for the service provider itself to be trusted
code, and hence be allowed to connect to hosts not allowed for
untrusted applets. In such a scenario, the service provider should
be careful not to compromise the security intended by the security
manager. If the service provider is sure that access by an
untrusted applet to the directory will cause no security problems,
then it may proceed to offer such a service to untrusted code. For
example, allowing untrusted code to access a directory
&quot;anonymously&quot; would post no security problems because the
directory already allows any anonymous client (written in the Java
programming language or otherwise) to access the same data.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998494" id="pgfId_998494"></a>Most
naming and directory services are accessed over the network.
Although the data requested is protected by the server's
authentication and access control mechanisms, some protocols do not
protect (encrypt) the data being sent as replies. Again, this is
not a problem particular to a client using JNDI but a problem for
any client accessing the directory. The service provider should
document the security implications associated with using the
associated directory over a network.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 class="subsection"><a name="pgfId_998495" id=
"pgfId_998495"></a>8.8.3 Accessing Local Files</h4>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998496" id=
"pgfId_998496"></a>Similar to network access, untrusted code has
limited access to the local file system. If the service provider
has special privileges for accessing local files, it should do so
with utmost precaution so as not to compromise the security
policies intended by the runtime/platform.</p>
<h4 class="subsection"><a name="pgfId_998497" id=
"pgfId_998497"></a>8.8.4 Privileged Code, Native Methods</h4>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998498" id="pgfId_998498"></a>A
service provider that is written completely in the Java programming
language with no privileged sections is controlled by the same
security policies afforded other code written in the Java
programming language. All protected resources that it attempts to
access go through the same security manager and access
controller.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998499" id="pgfId_998499"></a>If a
service provider contains privileged code sections, or if it
contains native methods, then it needs to be especially careful to
preserve the security policies intended by the
runtime/platform.</p>
