<h1>Java Debug Wire Protocol Transport Interface
(jdwpTransport)</h1>
<p>A transport is implemented as a series of functions in a dynamic
library (sometimes called a <i>DLL</i>, or <i>shared library</i>).
The library exports an <i>onload</i> function that is invoked by
the JDWP (or other) agent at startup-time.</p>
<p>Like JVMTI, jdwpTransport functions are accessed through an
interface pointer called the <i>environment pointer</i>. An
environment pointer is a pointer to an environment and has type
<tt>jdwpTransportEnv*</tt>. The environment pointer is returned to
the JDWP (or other) agent from the <i>onload</i> function.</p>
<p>A transport may support a single environment or it may support
multiple environments. In other words, a transport may be used by
only one, or multiple agents at the same time. If a transport
supports multiple environments then each call to the <i>onload</i>
function will return a new environment pointer. If a transport only
supports a single environment then second, and subsequent calls to
the <i>onload</i> function will return an error.</p>
<p>A transport is thread-safe and jdwpTransport functions can be
used by multiple concurrent threads. For example, one thread may be
blocked in the jdwpTransport <tt>ReadPacket</tt> function waiting
for a packet while another thread invokes <tt>WritePacket</tt>
function to write a packet.</p>
<p>In most cases jdwpTransport functions return a
<tt>jdwpTransportError</tt> value indicating return status. Some
functions return additional values through pointers provided by the
calling function. In cases where the return values are allocated by
a jdwpTransport function then the function will use the memory
allocation routine specified by the agent. The memory allocation
routines are specified to the transport, at start-up, via the
<i>onload</i> function.</p>
<p>In the event of an error (that is, one of the jdwpTransport
functions returns a value other than
<tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_NONE</tt>) then a string representing the
error can be subsequently obtained through a call to the
jdwpTransport function <tt>GetLastError</tt>. Errors are recorded
on a per-thread basis. The <tt>GetLastError</tt> function will
return a string represetning the last error that was encountered by
the current thread only.</p>
<h2>Developing a Transport implementation</h2>
<p>A transport library can be developed in any native language that
supports C language calling conventions and C or C++
definitions.</p>
<p>The function, data type, and constant definitions needed for
using the jdwpTransport interface are defined in the include file
jdwpTransport.h. To use these definitions add the Java SE include
directory to your include path :-</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
#include "jdwpTransport.h"
</pre>
<h2>Transport Start-Up</h2>
<p>The transport library must export an <i>onload</i> function with
the following prototype :-</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL 
jdwpTransport_OnLoad(JavaVM *jvm,
                     jdwpTransportCallback *callback,
                     jint version,
                     jdwpTransportEnv** env);
</pre>
<p>This function will be called by the JDWP (or other agent) when
the library is loaded.</p>
<p>The <tt>jvm</tt> argument is the <i>JNI invocation interface</i>
obtained by agent by invoking JNI's <tt>GetJavaVM</tt>
function.</p>
<p>The <tt>callback</tt> argument is a pointer to a function table
of memory management routines that the transport must use to
allocate the memory for return values that are allocated by the
transport implementation :-</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
typedef struct jdwpTransportCallback {
    void* (*alloc)(jint numBytes);
    void (*free)(void *buffer);
} jdwpTransportCallback;
</pre>
<p>The lifespan of the <tt>callback</tt> argument is the
<i>onload</i> function and therefore the transport must take a copy
of the function table in the <tt>jdwpTransport_OnLoad</tt>
function.</p>
<p>The function table has two entries. The <tt>alloc</tt> function
allocates an area of memory. It has a single argument to specify
the number of bytes to allocate. It returns a pointer to the
begining of the allocated memory, or NULL if the memory request
cannot be honored. If the number of bytes requested is zero then
NULL is returned. The <tt>free</tt> function deallocates an area of
memory that was previously allocated using the <tt>alloc</tt>
function.</p>
<p>The memory management functions provided by the agent are thread
safe and the transport implementation is not required to
synchronize calls to the these functions. The implementation of the
memory management functions are guaranteed not to call any
jdwpTransport function.</p>
<p><tt>version</tt> is the version of the transport interface that
the agent expects. This must be specified as
<tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_VERSION_1_0</tt>.</p>
<p><tt>env</tt> is a pointer to the environment pointer returned by
the function.</p>
<p>The <tt>jdwpTransport_OnLoad</tt> function returns
<tt>JNI_OK</tt> if the transport initializes successfully. If
initialization fails then one of the following errors is returned
:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
JNI_ENOMEM
JNI_EVERSION
JNI_EEXIST
</pre>
<p><tt>JNI_ENOMEM</tt> is returned if there is insufficient memory
to complete initialization.</p>
<p><tt>JNI_EVERSION</tt> is returned if the version in the
<tt>version</tt> argument is not
<tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_VERSION_1_0</tt>.</p>
<p><tt>JNI_EEXIST</tt> is returned if the transport only supports a
single environment, and the environment pointer was previously
returned by the first call to the <i>onload</i> function.</p>

<h2>Connection Management</h2>
<p>The connection management functions are used to establish and
close the connection to the debugger. A connection provides a
reliable flow of JDWP packets to and from the debugger. Packets
written to a connection are read, by the debugger, in exactly the
order in which they were written. Similarly, any packets written to
the connection by the debugger are read in the order in which they
were written.</p>
<p>Connections are established either <i>actively</i> or
<i>passively</i>. Establishing the connection <i>actively</i> means
that the jdwpTransport's <tt>Attach</tt> function is called to
initiate the connection the debugger. Establishing the connection
<i>passively</i> means that the jdwpTransport's
<tt>StartListening</tt> function is used to put the transport into
<i>listen mode</i> so that it listens for a connection from a
debugger. Once in listen mode the <tt>Accept</tt> function is used
to accept the connection. Irrespective of how the connection is
established the <tt>Close</tt> function is used to close the
connection, and <tt>IsOpen</tt> is used to test if a connection is
open to the debugger.</p>
<a name="Attach" id="Attach"></a>
<hr noshade="noshade" width="75%" />
<h3>Attach</h3>
<pre class="codeblock">
jdwpTransportError
Attach(jdwpTransportEnv* env, const char* address, 
       jlong attachTimeout, jlong handshakeTimeout)
</pre>
<p>Attaches to the debugger. Attaching to the debugger involves two
steps. First, a connection is established to the specified
<tt>address</tt>. Once a connection is established a
<i>handshake</i> is performed to ensure that the connection is
indeed established to a debugger. Handshaking involves the exchange
of ASCII string <i>JDWP-Handshake</i> as specified in the <a href=
"jdwp-spec.html">Java Debug Wire Protocol</a> specification.</p>
<p>The <tt>address</tt> argument is a pointer to a string
representing the address of the debugger. The exact format is
specific to the transport (In the case of a TCP/IP based transport
the address may include the hostname and port number of the
debugger. In the case of a transport that supports connections
through a serial port it might be the device name of the serial
port).</p>
<p>The <tt>attachTimeout</tt> argument specifies a timeout to use
when attaching. If the transport supports an attach timeout (see
<a href="#GetCapabilities">GetCapabilities</a>) and if the
<tt>attachTimeout</tt> is positive then it specifies the timeout,
in milliseconds (more or less), to use when attaching to the
debugger. If the transport does not support an attach timeout, or
if <tt>attachTimeout</tt> is specified as zero then a timeout is
not used when attaching.</p>
<p>The <tt>handshakeTimeout</tt> argument specifies a timeout to
use when handshaking with the debugger. If the transport supports a
handshake timeout (see <a href=
"#GetCapabilities">GetCapabilities</a>) and if the
<tt>handshakeTimeout</tt> is positive then it specifies the
timeout, in milliseconds (more or less), to use when handshaking
with the debugger. The exact usage of the handshake timeout is
specific to the transport - for example one implementation may use
the timeout as an inter-character timeout while waiting for the
<i>JDWP-Handshake</i> message from the debugger. Another
implementation may use the timeout to indicate the total duration
allowed for the handshake exchange. In general the purpose of the
handshake timeout is to allow for error handling in the event that
the transport connects to something other than a valid debugger. If
the transport does not support a handshake timeout, or if the
<tt>handshakeTimeout</tt> is specified as zero then a timeout is
not used when handshaking.</p>
<p>This function returns a <a href="#Universal">universal error</a>
or one of the following errors:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT
JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_ILLEGAL_STATE
JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_IO_ERROR
JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_TIMEOUT
</pre>
<p><tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT</tt> is returned if
<tt>address</tt> is invalid or <tt>timeout</tt> is negative.</p>
<p><tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_ILLEGAL_STATE</tt> is returned if the
transport is currently in <i>listen mode</i> (see <a href=
"#StartListening">StartListening</a>), or there is already an open
connection to the debugger (see <a href="#IsOpen">IsOpen</a>).</p>
<p><tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_IO_ERROR</tt> is returned if there is an
error (other than an attach timeout) attaching to the debugger.
Note that errors during the start-up handshake (including a
handshake timeout) are considered I/O errors. I/O errors are
specific to the transport. <a href="#GetLastError">GetLastError</a>
can be used to obtain a string representation of the error.</p>
<p><tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_TIMEOUT</tt> is returned if the
transport supports an attach timeout, and if the
<tt>attachTimeout</tt> value is positive, and if the connection to
the debugger cannot be established within that attachTimeout
period. <a name="StartListening" id="StartListening"></a></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" width="75%" />
<h3>StartListening</h3>
<pre class="codeblock">
jdwpTransportError
StartListening(jdwpTransportEnv* env, const char* address, char** actualAddress);
</pre>
<p>Puts the transport into <i>listen mode</i> to listen for a
connection from a debugger.</p>
<p>The <tt>address</tt> argument is a pointer to a string
representing the local address that the transport should listen on.
The exact format is specific to the transport (In the case of a
TCP/IP based transport the address might a local TCP port number.
In the case of a transport that supports connections through a
serial port it might be the device name of a serial port). The
<tt>address</tt> argument can be specified as <tt>NULL</tt> or as
an empty string (first character is <tt>\0</tt>). In that case the
transport listens on a default address that is specific to the
transport.</p>
<p>If <tt>actualAddress</tt> is not <tt>NULL</tt> then it is set to
the address of a string returned by the <tt>StartListening</tt>
function. The returned string will contain the string
representation of the address that the transport is listening on.
This may, or may not, differ from the address provided in the
<tt>address</tt> argument. The string is allocated using the
allocation callback provided to the transport when the
<tt>jdwpTransport_OnLoad</tt> function was called. The caller is
responsible for freeing the returned string.</p>
<p>This function returns a <a href="#Universal">universal error</a>
or one of the following errors:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT
JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_ILLEGAL_STATE
JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_IO_ERROR
</pre>
<p><tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT</tt> is returned if
<tt>address</tt> is invalid.</p>
<p><tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_ILLEGAL_STATE</tt> is returned if there
is already an open connection to a debugger (see <a href=
"#IsOpen">IsOpen</a>), or the transport is already in listen
mode.</p>
<p><tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_IO_ERROR</tt> is returned if there is an
error putting the transport into listen mode. The nature of the
error is specific to the transport. <a href=
"#GetLastError">GetLastError</a> can be used to obtain a string
representing the error.</p>
<a name="StopListening" id="StopListening"></a>
<hr noshade="noshade" width="75%" />
<h3>StopListening</h3>
<pre class="codeblock">
jdwpTransportError
StopListening(jdwpTransportEnv* env)
</pre>
<p>Takes the transport out of <i>listen mode</i> so that it's no
longer listening for connections from a debugger.</p>
<p>If the transport is in <i>listen mode</i> then it will be taken
out of this mode. If there is an open (see <a href=
"#IsOpen">IsOpen</a>) connection to a debugger then it is
unaffected by this function. In other words, <tt>StopListening</tt>
does not close a connection to the debugger. If the transport is
not in listen mode then this function does nothing and no error is
returned.</p>
<p>This function returns a <a href="#Universal">universal error</a>
or one of the following errors:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_IO_ERROR

<hr noshade="noshade" width="75%" />
<h3>Accept</h3>
<pre class="codeblock">
jdwpTransportError
Accept(jdwpTransportEnv* env, jlong acceptTimeout, jlong handshakeTimeout)
</pre>
<p>Accepts a connection from a debugger. Accepting a connection
from a debugger involves two steps. Firstly, a connection is
established by the debugger. Once a connection is established a
<i>handshake</i> is performed to ensure that the connection was
indeed established by a debugger. Handshaking involves the exchange
of ASCII string <i>JDWP-Handshake</i> as specified in the <a href=
"jdwp-spec.html">Java Debug Wire Protocol</a> specification.</p>
<p>The <tt>acceptTimeout</tt> argument specifies the timeout to use
while waiting for the debugger to connect. If the transport
supports an accept timeout (see <a href=
"#GetCapabilities">GetCapabilities</a>) and if the
<tt>acceptTimeout</tt> is positive then it specifies the timeout,
in milliseconds (more or less), to use when waiting for a
connection from a debugger. If the transport does not support an
accept timeout, or if <tt>timeout</tt> is specified as zero then
block indefinitely waiting for a connection.</p>
<p>The <tt>handshakeTimeout</tt> argument specifies a timeout to
use when handshaking with the debugger. If the transport supports a
handshake timeout (see <a href=

<p><b>Note:</b> A thread that is blocked in <tt>Accept</tt> waiting
for a connection from a debugger can be interrupted by another
thread calling <tt>StopListening</tt>. In that case the thread that
called <tt>Accept</tt> will return

<p>Reads a JDWP packet from an open connection to a debugger.</p>
<p>This function does a <i>blocking read</i> on an open connection.
It blocks indefinitely until a complete JDWP packet can be
returned, or in the case of a transport based on a stream-oriented
protocol, end-of-stream is encountered.</p>
<p>The <tt>packet</tt> argument is the address of a
<tt>jdwpPacket</tt> structure that is populated by this function.
The <tt>packet.type.cmd.len</tt> or <tt>packet.type.reply.len</tt>
field (depending on if the packet is a command or reply packet) is
populated with the length of the packet. If end of stream is
encountered the length field will be set to <tt>0</tt> and all
other fields in the packet will be undefined. If end of stream is
encountered after reading some, but not all, bytes of a packet it
is considered an I/O error and
<tt>JDWPTRANSPORT_ERROR_IO_ERROR</tt> will be returned. In that
case the length field will not be populated. When an entire packet
is read then all fields in the packet are populated with values in

require when transmitting JDWP packets.</p>
<p>The <tt>packet.type.cmd.data</tt> or
