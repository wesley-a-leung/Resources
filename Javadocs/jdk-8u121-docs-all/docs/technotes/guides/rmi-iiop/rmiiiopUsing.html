<h1>When should I use RMI-IIOP?</h1>
<p>RMI-IIOP is for developers who program in the Java programming
language and want to program to the RMI interfaces, but use IIOP as
the underlying transport. RMI-IIOP provides interoperability with
other CORBA objects implemented in various languages - but only if
all the remote interfaces are originally defined as Java RMI
interfaces. It is of particular interest to programmers using
Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), since the remote object
model for EJB components is based on the RMI API.</p>
<p>RMI-IIOP combines the best features of Java Remote Method
Invocation (RMI) with the best features of CORBA. RMI-IIOP speeds
distributed application development by allowing developers to work
completely in the Java programming language, writing remote
interfaces in the Java programming language and implementing them
simply using Java technology and the Java RMI APIs.</p>
<p>When using RMI-IIOP to produce technology-based distributed
applications written in the Java programming language, there is no
separate Interface Definition Language (IDL) or mapping to learn:
the remote interfaces can be implemented in any other language that
is supported by an OMG mapping and a vendor supplied ORB for that
language. Similarly, clients can be written in other languages
using IDL derived from the remote Java technology-based
interfaces.</p>
<p>RMI-IIOP provides flexibility by allowing developers to pass any
Java object between application components either by reference or
by value.</p>
<p>Like CORBA, RMI-IIOP is based on open standards defined with the
participation of hundreds of vendors and users in the Object
Management Group. Like CORBA, RMI-IIOP uses Internet Inter-ORB
Protocol (IIOP) as its communication protocol. IIOP eases legacy
application and platform integration by allowing application
components written in C++, Smalltalk, and other CORBA supported
languages to communicate with components running on the Java
platform. <a name="other" id="other"></a></p>
<h2>What other options do I have for distributed
application development?</h2>
<p>Developers who program using the Java programming language can choose several
solutions for creating distributed applications programs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Java RMI</strong>
technology - If all of your applications are written in the Java
programming language, you will probably want to use <a href=
"../rmi/index.html">Java RMI technology</a> to enable communication
between Java objects on different virtual machines and different
physical machines. Using Java RMI technology without its IIOP
option leverages its strengths of code portability, security, and
garbage collection.</li>
<li><strong>Java IDL</strong>
technology - <a target="AuxWindow" href="../idl/index.html">Java
IDL technology</a> are for CORBA programmers who want to program in
the Java programming language based on interfaces defined in CORBA
Interface Definition Language (IDL). This is "business as usual"
CORBA programming, supporting the Java platform in exactly the same
way as other languages like C++ or COBOL.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise JavaBeans technology</strong> - <a target="AuxWindow"
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-140203.html">Enterprise
JavaBeans</a>
(EJB) technology is part of the
Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE). EJB components use the Java
RMI/Java IDL technology for their distributed object model, and use
the Java Transaction Service (JTS) for their distributed
transaction model. When Enterprise JavaBeans components are
implemented using the RMI-IIOP protocol for EJB component
interoperability in heterogeneous server environments, the standard
mapping of the EJB architecture to CORBA enables interoperability
with multivendor ORBs, other EJB servers, and CORBA clients written
in programming languages other than the Java programming language.
For an example application that uses an EJB server with a CORBA
client, look at <a target="AuxWindow" href=

Clients</em></a>.</li>
