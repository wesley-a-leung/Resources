<h2><a name="features" id="features">Major Features</a></h2>
<h3><a name="gif" id="gif">A writer plug-in for the GIF file
format</a></h3>
<p>While reading capabilities for the GIF file format have been
available since Java SE 1.4, the
<code>com.sun.media.imageio.plugins.gif</code> package lacked a
writer. The newly added GIF image writer enables writing images
which satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of bands is 1</li>
<li>The number of bits per sample is not greater than 8</li>
<li>The size of a color component is not greater than 8</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the GIF images writer supports the animated GIF
images creation through the standard methods defined in the
<a href="../../../api/javax/imageio/ImageWriter.html"><code>ImageWriter</code></a>
class. See more details about the GIF images writer in the <a href=
"../../../api/javax/imageio/package-summary.html#gif_plugin_notes">Standard
plug-in for GIF image format notes</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="filtering" id="filtering">New methods for file formats
filtering</a></h3>
Two new methods were introduced in the <a href=
"../../../api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html"><code>ImageIO</code></a>
class that obtain file suffixes to be filtered. The <a href=
"../../../api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html#getReaderFileSuffixes--"><code>
getReaderFileSuffixes()</code></a> and <a href=
"../../../api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html#getWriterFileSuffixes--"><code>
getWriterFileSuffixes</code></a> methods return an array of
<code>Strings</code> listing all of the file suffixes associated
with the formats recognized by the current set of registered
readers and writers.
<h2><a name="fixes" id="fixes">Fixed Bugs</a></h2>
<h3><a name="fixDoc" id="fixDoc">API and doc changes</a></h3>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4953566"><strong>4953566</strong></a>
The <code>mark()</code> or <code>reset()</code> methods of the
<code>ImageInputStream class</code> do not work properly with PNG
<code>ImageReader</code>:</h3>
<p>The following note was added to the
<code>ImageInputStream</code> class specification to clarify that
<code>ImageReader</code> classes are allowed to call the
<code>flushBefore()</code> as part of the decoding process:</p>
<p>Note that it is valid for an ImageReader to call flushBefore as
part of a read operation. Therefore, if an application calls the
mark prior to passing that stream to an ImageReader, the
application should not assume that the marked position will remain
valid after the read operation has completed.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=5068322"><strong>5068322</strong></a>
The <code>javax.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGQTable.toString()</code>
method produces incorrect description:</h3>
The <code>toString()</code> method of the <code>JPEGQTable</code>
class in the package <code>javax.imageio.plugins.jpeg</code> was
supposed to return a <code>String</code> object containing the
values of the table, but instead repeated only the first line of
the table. The performed fix eliminate this error.
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6359957"><strong>6359957</strong></a>
Wrong doc URL reference for PNG specification:</h3>
<p>The link to the PNG specification in the <a href=
"../../../api/javax/imageio/metadata/package-summary.html" target=
"classFrame">javax.imageio.metadata</a> package was corrected to
the following URL:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/</a></p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6457035"><strong>6457035</strong></a>
javadoc for <code>ImageInputStreamImpl.read()</code> method is
missing:</h3>
The <code>ImageInputStreamImpl.java</code> file had a missing '*'
character at the beginning of the javadoc for the abstract
<code>read()</code> method definition.The fix fills in the missing
character.
<h3><a name="fixBMP" id="fixBMP">BMP plugin improvements</a></h3>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6294920">6294920</a> The
<code>BMPImageReader</code> class fails to read
<code>3BYTE_BGR</code> images encoded using BMP Writer with
<code>BI_JPEG</code> compression:</h3>
<p>While attempting to write an image of the <code>BI_JPEG</code>
compression type, the <code>java.io.EOFException</code> was thrown
by the <code>BMPImageReader</code> class. The problem was that the
<code>BMPImageReader</code> class did not process embedded images
both of <code>BI_JPEG</code> and <code>BI_PNG</code> types. To
resolve this problem, the embedded image handling is moved to
separate code.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6297016">6297016</a> Output
BMP image is distorted when writing <code>TYPE_3BYTE_BGR</code>
buffered image with <code>BI_BITFIELDS</code> compression:</h3>
<p>While attempting to write a buffered image of the
<code>TYPE_3BYTE_BGR</code> type to a file using the
<code>BMPWriter</code> class and the <code>BI_BITFIELDS</code>
compression type, the output image was distorted and unusable. This
problem was caused by the bitfileds masks which were applied to a
bmp image. However, an image data layout was not changed according
to the BMP format requirements. To fix this problem the
<code>writePixels()</code> method is used to copy image data
correctly.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=5076878">5076878</a>
ImageIO BMP Writer writes 32 bit files for 24 bit images:</h3>
<p>The <code>ImageIO.write</code> method presented a BMP file as a
32 bit image even if the source image had 24 bits per pixel
presentation. The fix enables the <code>writePixels</code>
procedure whenever the number of bits per pixel is smaller than the
size of a databuffer type (for example, with
<code>TYPE_INT_RGB,</code> the actual number of bits per pixel is
24 while the size of the databuffer type is 32).</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6332480">6332480</a> The
<code>BMPReader</code> class fails to read the
<code>TYPE_BYTE_GRAY</code> image encoded by the
<code>BMPWriter</code> class with <code>BI_RLE8</code>
compression:</h3>
<p>The <code>BMPReader</code> class did not properly read the
<code>TYPE_BYTE_GRAY</code> image written with the
<code>BMPWriter</code> class using the <code>BI_RLE8</code>
compression. The problem was that the RLE decoding procedures (both
RLE4 and RLE8) mistakenly used the width of the destination region
instead of the height to calculate the range of image lines for
copying. The performed fix uses the height of the destination
region to calculate the range.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6399660">6399660</a> Using
subsampling with compression alters the colors for some of the
image types for BMP:</h3>
<p>While using all the supported compression types for BMP,
different affects on image were detected including blurring, a
different color appearance, and slight image corruption. The
performed fix separates processing BI_RGB compression and BI_RGB
compression as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For BI_RGB compression the BGR order of raster data should be
used (except the case of 16bpp images where RGB data order is
defined by the BMP spec)</li>
<li>For BI_BITFIELDS compression the order of raster data should be
defined using corresponding masks. The RGB order of raster data is
used for the default bitfields masks.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="fixPerf" id="fixPerf">Performance and resource
management</a></h3>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6299405"><strong>6299405</strong></a>
The <code>ImageInputStreamImpl</code> class still uses the
<code>finalize()</code> method which causes the
<code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</code>:</h3>
<p>The <code>finalize()</code> method had to be emptied and its
functionality (closing the stream) must be replaced with a more
prompt mechanism. The finalize() method cannot be easily emptied at
the <code>ImageInputStreamImpl</code> level, since third-party IISI
subclasses may rely on the <code>finalize()</code> method calling
their <code>close()</code> method as per the spec. However, for
<code>ImageInputStreamImpl</code> subclasses under Oracle control, the
<code>finalize()</code> methods can be emptied. The Java2D Disposer
mechanism is used instead.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6266748"><strong>6266748</strong></a>
The <code>JPEGImageWriter.write()</code> method makes a copy of the
raster:</h3>
<p>The write() method of the <code>JPEGImageWriter</code> class
contained memory-inefficient code. The suggested fix helps to
improve performance for simple rendered images.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6336804"><strong>6336804</strong></a>
The <code>javax.imageio.ImageIO</code> class can handle leaks in
some methods:</h3>
<p>Some of the <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code>
convenience methods in the <code>javax.imageio.ImageIO</code> class
did not properly close streams and dispose reader or writer
instances in a try and finally blocks. As a fix the appropriate
notes were added to each method's javadocs indicating whether it is
the caller's responsibility to close the provided stream or
not.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6347575"><strong>6347575</strong></a>
FileImageInputStream.readInt() and similar methods are
inefficient:</h3>
Calling the <code>read()</code> method of the
<code>FileImageInputStream</code> 4x was much more expensive than
making a single call to the <code>read(byte[])</code> method with a
cached byte array. This fact had a profound impact on performance
of reading small PNG and other images. The fixes were performed for
the <code>readShort()</code> and <code>readInt()</code> methods of
the <code>ImageInputStreamImpl</code> class.
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6348744"><strong>6348744</strong></a>
The <code>PNGImageReader</code> class should skip metadata if the
<code>ignoreMetadata</code> flag has the <code>true</code>
value:</h3>
<p>Before JDK 6, the <code>PNGImageReader</code> class read all
image metadata, even if the <code>ignoreMetadata</code> flag was
set. The fix reduces overhead and improves performance when reading
small PNG images by skipping metadata blocks if the
<code>ignoreMetadata</code> flag is <code>true</code>.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6354056"><strong>6354056</strong></a>
The <code>JPEGImageReader</code> class could be optimized:</h3>
<p>The JPEG image reader copied decoded data into memory, but not
in an optimized way. The performed fix improves this operation by
using the <code>memcpy()</code> method instead of copying one byte
at a time.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6354112"><strong>6354112</strong></a>
Increase compiler optimization level for <code>libjpeg</code> to
improve runtime performance:</h3>
<p>The <code>libjpeg</code> library in the JDK was built with
default compiler optimization flags. The values of these flags are
increased to a higher level to enable the native IJG JPEG libraries
to run faster.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6404011"><strong>6404011</strong></a>
IllegalArgumentException: &quot;Invalid ICC Profile Data&quot; when
reading a certain JPEG image:</h3>
<p>This bug was an unchecked exception and could cause a system
crash on some platforms. The fix catches the
<code>IllegalArgumentException</code>, which is thrown by
ICC_Profile, and handles images without taking into account invalid
color profiles.</p>
<h3><a name="fixRobust" id="fixRobust">Robustness</a></h3>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6291034"><strong>6291034</strong></a>
The <code>IFileCacheImageInputStream</code> and
<code>FileCacheImageOutputStream</code> should avoid using the
<code>File.deleteOnExit</code> method:</h3>
Both the <code>FileCacheImageInputStream</code> and
<code>FileCacheImageOutputStream</code> classes used the
functionality of the <code>deleteOnExit</code> method of the
<code>File</code> class. The fix has replaced the
File.deleteOnExit() functionality with the shutdown hook that
closes streams that are still open before the VM shutdown.
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4892630"><strong>4892630</strong></a>
The <code>ImageReader</code> class does not validate the image
index which is passed to some of the methods:</h3>
<p>The <code>getWidth(imgIndex)</code>,
<code>getHeight(imgIndex)</code>, and
<code>getAspectRatio(imgIndex)</code> methods of the
<code>ImageReader</code> class did not throw the
<code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code> if the given PNG image index
was out of range. The performed fix resolves this issue by throwing
the exception appropriately.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4895547"><strong>4895547</strong></a>
<code>JPEGImageMetadata</code> obtained from reader throws
<code>NullPointerException</code> when calling the
<code>mergeTree()</code> method:</h3>
<p>The list of parent attributes did not contain attributes related
to the child node and this fact caused the
<code>NullPointerException</code> in the
<code>MarkerSegment.getAttributeValue()</code> method while trying
to get child related attribute. The performed fix obtains the
attribute list from the child node.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4528643"><strong>4528643</strong></a>
Native JPEG code makes JNI calls in scope of
GetPrimitiveArrayCritical:</h3>
<p>Running any application that reads or writes JPEG images with
the non-standard <code>-Xcheck:jni</code> flag caused the following
error in several methods of the <code>JPEGImageReader</code>
class:</p>
<pre>
Calling other JNI functions in the scope of Get/ReleasePrimitiveArrayCritical or Get/ReleaseStringCritical
</pre>
<p>In the fix, the affected methods are surrounded with the
RELEASE/GET_ARRAYS macros.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=5076692"><strong>5076692</strong></a>
Installed Extensions Image I/O reader-writer plug-ins unusable in
applet context:</h3>
The problem was that the <code>imageio</code> registry
initialization code did not have read access to jars in the
<code>java.ext.dirs</code> when the registry code was called from
applet context. Therefore, the <code>imageio</code> plugins
installed to <code>java.ext.dirs</code> were not available in case
of applets. The fix idea is to register plugins from
<code>java.ext.dirs</code> in the privileged action block.
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6342404"><strong>6342404</strong></a>
The <code>ImageIO</code> plugin failure causes all readers to
fail:</h3>
<p>Removing an <code>ImageIO</code> plugin's code from the
classpath, but still including an entry for the plugin's
ImageReader in META-INF/services made using any of the ImageIO
plugins impossible. To fix this bug, a 'try and catch' block was
added to the
<code>IIORegistry.registerApplicationClasspathSpis()</code> method
to catch the <code>ServiceConfigurationError</code>.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6395551"><strong>6395551</strong></a>
Setting the destination type to type specifier returned by
redr.getImageTypes() throws exception for JPG:</h3>
<p>The problem was that a new <code>ColorSpace</code> instance was
re-created for embedded color profiles whenever an image header was
read. In addition, there was no means for correct comparison of
<code>ColorSpace</code> and <code>ICC_Profile</code> classes. This
omission made comparing instances of
<code>ImageTypeSpecifier</code> class impossible. The proposed
workaround for this problem is as follows: to detect the case when
the <code>iccCS</code> instance contains the same profile data as a
newly read. If so, the 'old' instance is left; otherwise (if the
profile data seems to be different) a new color space instance is
created for the embedded color profile.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6399616"><strong>6399616</strong></a>
PIT: <code>JPGReader</code> throws an exception when using the
<code>TYPE_CUSTOM TypeSpecifier</code> returned by the
<code>Reader.getImageTypes</code> method:</h3>
<p>The regression was caused by the fix for <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4705399"><strong>4705399</strong></a>,
where color conversion was removed
(<code>JPEGImageReader.java</code> lines 783 -786) because it
caused extra color conversion for images with embedded color
profiles. However, this conversion was required when the
destination type defined different color spaces for images that do
not contain embedded profiles. The fix for this case converts image
data from sRGB (produced by the decoder) to the color space used in
the destination image.</p>
<h3><a name="fixQuality" id="fixQuality">Quality</a></h3>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=5028259"><strong>5028259</strong></a>
Setting the destination image type for jpeg images increases the
size of the result file:</h3>
<p>If the write parameter with the destination type was used
explicitly to write a jpeg image, then the size of the result file
was bigger than if the same destination type was used implicitly.
The problem was revealed when the destination type was specified
but the corresponding metadata object was not specified. The fix
creates the metadata object using the given destination type in
order to build a SOF marker object, which will be used to change
the default values of the <code>QtableSelectors</code>.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4881314"><strong>4881314</strong></a>
<code>ImageIO</code> does not correctly read certain standard JPG
files:</h3>
The <code>ImageIO</code> incorrectly reads some JPG files. The
result was a red or green image that looked like a photographic
negative. The fix eliminates color space conversion for EXIF
images. To detect EXIF images, the check for the APP1 marker in the
image header is added.
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=5098176"><strong>5098176</strong></a>
Some PNG images fail to load with the <code>ImageIO</code>
class:</h3>
The <code>PNGImageReader</code> failed to create the
<code>ImageTypeSpecifier</code> instance corresponding to the
indexed PNG image if the length of the image palette in smaller
than 2 bitDepth. To avoid this limitation new palette arrays of the
appropriate power of 2 size were created. These arrays are padded
with the last value from original arrays in order to avoid the
appearance of colors that do not exist in the original palette.
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6372769"><strong>6372769</strong></a>
The <code>ImageIO.read</code> method improperly decodes Nikon
Jpegs:</h3>
<p>The <code>ImageIO</code> jpeg reader performed extra color
conversion if an image contained the embedded color profile. The
bug was fixed by removing the extra color conversion operation.</p>
<h3><a name="fixMisc" id="fixMisc">Miscellaneous</a></h3>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4972087"><strong>4972087</strong></a>
<code>Quality Desc</code> and <code>Quality Values</code> arrays
are of the same length for JPG:</h3>
<p>The <code>JPEGImageWriteParam</code> class was updated so that
the <code>getCompressionQualityValues()</code> method returns an
array whose length is one larger than the array returned by
<code>getCompressionQualityDescriptions()</code>, as per the
specification.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6195593"><strong>6195593</strong></a>
REGRESSION: The <code>javax/imageio/IRPTest.java</code> file
fails:</h3>
<p>The problem was caused by the fix for the bug <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=5039494"><strong>5039494</strong></a>.
Starting with this fix, the
<code>ImageReader.computeRegion()</code> method was used to
calculate the destination region. In order to avoid discrepancies
between calculated destination regions and destinations offset from
the parameter, the <code>destinationOffset</code> is updated
according to the calculated values.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6304433"><strong>6304433</strong></a>
Test bug: the regression test for the bug 6291034 fails on all
platforms:</h3>
<p>The regression test failure was caused by the creation of an
output image file. This file was created after counting the
existing files in the work directory and was not deleted on
regression test finish. So, after regression test execution, the
work directory always contained one extra file, although all
temporary files were deleted upon VM exit. The solution is to use
byte array input or output streams instead of file input or output
streams in order to avoid creating extra files in the work
directory.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6356926"><strong>6356926</strong></a>
PIT: The regression test
<code>javax/imageio/stream/DeleteOnExit.sh</code> is failing:</h3>
<p>The problem was caused by the fix for the bug <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6299405"><strong>6299405</strong></a>.
The affected code is fixed and the corresponding comment has been
added.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6459309"><strong>6459309</strong></a>
The <code>NoAPP0Test.java</code> regression test failed on all
platforms:</h3>
<p>The difference in pixel values is caused by using new version of
sRGB profile that was updated as part of fix for 6279846. New
profile was integrated in the b92 build.</p>
<h3><a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6363748"><strong>6363748</strong></a>
The <code>close()</code> method of the
<code>FileCacheImageInputStream</code> class fails:</h3>
<p>The problem was caused by the fix for the bug <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6299405"><strong>6299405</strong></a>.
As a part of that fix the
<code>FileCacheImageInputStream.close()</code> method was changed
so that it nulled out its reference to the cache object. To
eliminate this issue the <code>FCIIS.read()</code> method is
updated to call the <code>checkClosed()</code> method as it is
supposed to do.</p>
