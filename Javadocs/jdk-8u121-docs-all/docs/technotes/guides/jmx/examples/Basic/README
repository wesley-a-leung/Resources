#  JMX Tutorial Example
#
#  The aim of this example is to show the basic use of the JMX technology. It
#  shows the use of standard and dynamic MBeans, and how to perform operations
#  locally and remotely, through the RMI connector. In this example both the
#  SimpleStandard MBean and the SimpleDynamic MBean expose the same management
#  interface.
#
# ==============================================================================
#
# In order to compile and run the example, make a copy of this README file, and
# then simply cut and paste all the commands as needed into a terminal window.
#
# This README makes the assumption that you are running under Java SE 6 on Unix,
# you are familiar with the JMX technology, and with the bourne shell or korn
# shell syntax.
#
# All the commands below are defined using Unix korn shell syntax.
#
# If you are not running Unix and korn shell you are expected to be able to
# adapt these commands to your favorite OS and shell environment.
#

# Compile Java classes
#
# * Server.java: creates an MBeanServer,
#                registers a SimpleStandard MBean on the local MBeanServer,
#                registers a SimpleDynamic MBean on the local MBeanServer,
#                performs local operations on both MBeans,
#                creates and starts an RMI connector server (JRMP).
#
# * Client.java: creates an RMI connector (JRMP),
#                registers a SimpleStandard MBean on the remote MBeanServer,
#                registers a SimpleDynamic MBean on the remote MBeanServer,
#                performs remote operations on both MBeans,
#                closes the RMI connector.
#
# * ClientListener.java: implements a generic notification listener.
#
# * SimpleStandard.java: implements the Simple standard MBean.
#
# * SimpleStandardMBean.java: the management interface exposed
#                             by the Simple standard MBean.
#
# * SimpleDynamic.java: implements the Simple dynamic MBean.
#

javac *.java

# Start the RMI registry:
#

rmiregistry 9999 &

# Start the Server (follow the server's execution steps
#                   until it prompts you to start the
#                   client on a different shell window)
#

java -classpath . Server

# Start the Client (on a different shell window)
#

java -classpath . Client
