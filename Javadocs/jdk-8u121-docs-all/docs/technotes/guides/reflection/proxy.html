<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>A <i>dynamic proxy class</i> is a class that implements a list
of interfaces specified at runtime such that a method invocation
through one of the interfaces on an instance of the class will be
encoded and dispatched to another object through a uniform
interface. Thus, a dynamic proxy class can be used to create a
type-safe proxy object for a list of interfaces without requiring
pre-generation of the proxy class, such as with compile-time tools.
Method invocations on an instance of a dynamic proxy class are
dispatched to a single method in the instance's <i>invocation
handler</i>, and they are encoded with a
<code>java.lang.reflect.Method</code> object identifying the method
that was invoked and an array of type <code>Object</code>
containing the arguments.</p>
<p>Dynamic proxy classes are useful to an application or library
that needs to provide type-safe reflective dispatch of invocations
on objects that present interface APIs. For example, an application
can use a dynamic proxy class to create an object that implements
multiple arbitrary event listener interfaces-- interfaces that
extend <code>java.util.EventListener</code>-- to process a variety
of events of different types in a uniform fashion, such as by
logging all such events to a file.</p>
<h2><a name="api" id="api">Dynamic Proxy Class API</a></h2>
<p>A <i>dynamic proxy class</i> (simply referred to as a <i>proxy
class</i> below) is a class that implements a list of interfaces
specified at runtime when the class is created.</p>
<p>A <i>proxy interface</i> is such an interface that is
implemented by a proxy class.</p>
<p>A <i>proxy instance</i> is an instance of a <i>proxy
class</i>.</p>
<h3>Creating a Proxy Class</h3>
<p>Proxy classes, as well as instances of them, are created using
the static methods of the class <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html">java.lang.reflect.Proxy</a></tt>.</p>
<p>The <code>Proxy.getProxyClass</code> method returns the
<code>java.lang.Class</code> object for a proxy class given a class
loader and an array of interfaces. The proxy class will be defined
in the specified class loader and will implement all of the
supplied interfaces. If a proxy class for the same permutation of
interfaces has already been defined in the class loader, then the
existing proxy class will be returned; otherwise, a proxy class for
those interfaces will be generated dynamically and defined in the
class loader.</p>
<p>There are several restrictions on the parameters that may be
passed to <code>Proxy.getProxyClass</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the <code>Class</code> objects in the
<code>interfaces</code> array must represent interfaces, not
classes or primitive types.</li>
<li>No two elements in the <code>interfaces</code> array may refer
to identical <code>Class</code> objects.</li>
<li>All of the interface types must be visible by name through the
specified class loader. In other words, for class loader
<code>cl</code> and every interface <code>i</code>, the following
expression must be true:
<pre>
        Class.forName(i.getName(), false, cl) == i
</pre></li>
<li>All non-public interfaces must be in the same package;
otherwise, it would not be possible for the proxy class to
implement all of the interfaces, regardless of what package it is
defined in.</li>
<li>For any set of member methods of the specified interfaces that
have the same signature:
<ul>
<li>If the return type of any of the methods is a primitive type or
void, then all of the methods must have that same return type.</li>
<li>Otherwise, one of the methods must have a return type that is
assignable to all of the return types of the rest of the
methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The resulting proxy class must not exceed any limits imposed on
classes by the virtual machine. For example, the VM may limit the
number of interfaces that a class may implement to 65535; in that
case, the size of the <code>interfaces</code> array must not exceed
65535.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these restrictions are violated,
<code>Proxy.getProxyClass</code> will throw an
<code>IllegalArgumentException</code>. If the
<code>interfaces</code> array argument or any of its elements are
<code>null</code>, a <code>NullPointerException</code> will be
thrown.</p>
<p>Note that the order of the specified proxy interfaces is
significant: two requests for a proxy class with the same
combination of interfaces but in a different order will result in
two distinct proxy classes. Proxy classes are distinguished by the
order of their proxy interfaces in order to provide deterministic
method invocation encoding in cases where two or more of the proxy
interfaces share a method with the same name and parameter
signature; this reasoning is described in more detail in the
section below titled <a href="#methods"><b>Methods Duplicated in
Multiple Proxy Interfaces</b></a>.</p>
<p>So that a new proxy class does not need to be generated each
time <code>Proxy.getProxyClass</code> is invoked with the same
class loader and list of interfaces, the implementation of the
dynamic proxy class API should keep a cache of generated proxy
classes, keyed by their corresponding loaders and interface list.
The implementation should be careful not to refer to the class
loaders, interfaces, and proxy classes in such a way as to prevent
class loaders, and all of their classes, from being garbage
collected when appropriate.</p>
<h3>Proxy Class Properties</h3>
<p>A proxy class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proxy classes are public, final, and not abstract.</li>
<li>The unqualified name of a proxy class is unspecified. The space
of class names that begin with the string <code>"$Proxy"</code> is,
however, to be reserved for proxy classes.</li>
<li>A proxy class extends <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html">java.lang.reflect.Proxy</a></code>.</li>
<li>A proxy class implements exactly the interfaces specified at
its creation, in the same order.</li>
<li>If a proxy class implements a non-public interface, then it
will be defined in the same package as that interface. Otherwise,
the package of a proxy class is also unspecified. Note that package
sealing will not prevent a proxy class from being successfully
defined in a particular package at runtime, and neither will
classes already defined in the same class loader and the same
package with particular signers.</li>
<li>Since a proxy class implements all of the interfaces specified
at its creation, invoking <code>getInterfaces</code> on its
<code>Class</code> object will return an array containing the same
list of interfaces (in the order specified at its creation),
invoking <code>getMethods</code> on its <code>Class</code> object
will return an array of <code>Method</code> objects that include
all of the methods in those interfaces, and invoking
<code>getMethod</code> will find methods in the proxy interfaces as
would be expected.</li>
<li>The <code>Proxy.isProxyClass</code> method will return true if
it is passed a proxy class-- a class returned by
<code>Proxy.getProxyClass</code> or the class of an object returned
by <code>Proxy.newProxyInstance</code>-- and false otherwise. The
reliability of this method is important for the ability to use it
to make security decisions, so its implementation should not just
test if the class in question extends
<code>java.lang.reflect.Proxy</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>java.security.ProtectionDomain</code> of a proxy
class is the same as that of system classes loaded by the bootstrap
class loader, such as <code>java.lang.Object</code>, because the
code for a proxy class is generated by trusted system code. This
protection domain will typically be granted
<code>java.security.AllPermission</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating a Proxy Instance</h3>
<p>Each proxy class has one public constructor that takes one
argument, an implementation of the interface <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/reflect/InvocationHandler.html">InvocationHandler</a></code>.</p>
<p>Each proxy instance has an associated invocation handler object,
the one that was passed to its constructor. Rather than having to
use the reflection API to access the public constructor, a proxy
instance can be also be created by calling the
<code>Proxy.newProxyInstance</code> method, which combines the
actions of calling <code>Proxy.getProxyClass</code> with invoking
the constructor with an invocation handler.
<code>Proxy.newProxyInstance</code> throws
<code>IllegalArgumentException</code> for the same reasons that
<code>Proxy.getProxyClass</code> does.</p>
<h3>Proxy Instance Properties</h3>
<p>A proxy instance has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a proxy instance <code>proxy</code> and one of the
interfaces implemented by its proxy class <code>Foo</code>, the
following expression will return true:
<pre>
        <code>proxy instanceof Foo</code>
</pre>
and the following cast operation will succeed (rather than throwing
a <code>ClassCastException</code>):
<pre>
        <code>(Foo) proxy</code>
</pre></li>
<li>The static <code>Proxy.getInvocationHandler</code> method will
return the invocation handler associated with the proxy instance
passed as its argument. If the object passed to
<code>Proxy.getInvocationHandler</code> is not a proxy instance,
then an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> will be thrown.</li>
<li>An interface method invocation on a proxy instance will be
encoded and dispatched to the invocation handler's
<code>invoke</code> method as described below.
<p>The proxy instance itself will be passed as the first argument
of <code>invoke</code>, which is of type <code>Object</code>.</p>
<p>The second argument passed to <code>invoke</code> will be the
<code>java.lang.reflect.Method</code> instance corresponding to the
interface method invoked on the proxy instance. The declaring class
of the <code>Method</code> object will be the interface that the
method was declared in, which may be a superinterface of the proxy
interface that the proxy class inherits the method through.</p>
<p>The third argument passed to <code>invoke</code> will be an
array of objects containing the values of the arguments passed in
the method invocation on the proxy instance. Arguments of primitive
types are wrapped in an instance of the appropriate primitive
wrapper class, such as <code>java.lang.Integer</code> or
<code>java.lang.Boolean</code>. The implementation of the
<code>invoke</code> method is free to modify the contents of this
array.</p>
<p>The value returned by the <code>invoke</code> method will become
the return value of the method invocation on the proxy instance. If
the declared return value of the interface method is a primitive
type, then the value returned by <code>invoke</code> must be an
instance of the corresponding primitive wrapper class; otherwise,
it must be a type assignable to the declared return type. If the
value returned by <code>invoke</code> is <code>null</code> and the
interface method's return type is primitive, then a
<code>NullPointerException</code> will be thrown by the method
invocation on the proxy instance. If the value returned by
<code>invoke</code> is otherwise not compatible with the method's
declared return type as described above, a
<code>ClassCastException</code> will be thrown by the proxy
instance.</p>
<p>If an exception is thrown by the <code>invoke</code> method, it
will be also thrown by the method invocation on the proxy instance.
The exception's type must be assignable to either any of the
exception types declared in the signature of the interface method
or to the unchecked exception types
<code>java.lang.RuntimeException</code> or
<code>java.lang.Error</code>. If a checked exception is thrown by
<code>invoke</code> that is not assignable to any of the exception
types declared in the <code>throws</code> clause of the interface
method, then an <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/reflect/UndeclaredThrowableException.html">UndeclaredThrowableException</a></code>
will be thrown by the method invocation on the proxy instance. The
<code>UndeclaredThrowableException</code> will be constructed with
the exception that was thrown by the <code>invoke</code>
method.</p>
</li>
<li>An invocation of the <code>hashCode</code>,
<code>equals</code>, or <code>toString</code> methods declared in
<code>java.lang.Object</code> on a proxy instance will be encoded
and dispatched to the invocation handler's <code>invoke</code>
method in the same manner as interface method invocations are
encoded and dispatched, as described above. The declaring class of
the <code>Method</code> object passed to <code>invoke</code> will
be <code>java.lang.Object</code>. Other public methods of a proxy
instance inherited from <code>java.lang.Object</code> are not
overridden by a proxy class, so invocations of those methods behave
like they do for instances of <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="methods" id="methods">Methods Duplicated in Multiple
Proxy Interfaces</a></h3>
<p>When two or more interfaces of a proxy class contain a method
with the same name and parameter signature, the order of the proxy
class's interfaces becomes significant. When such a <i>duplicate
method</i> is invoked on a proxy instance, the <code>Method</code>
object passed to the invocation handler will not necessarily be the
one whose declaring class is assignable from the reference type of
the interface that the proxy's method was invoked through. This
limitation exists because the corresponding method implementation
in the generated proxy class cannot determine which interface it
was invoked through. Therefore, when a duplicate method is invoked
on a proxy instance, the <code>Method</code> object for the method
in the foremost interface that contains the method (either directly
or inherited through a superinterface) in the proxy class's list of
interfaces is passed to the invocation handler's
<code>invoke</code> method, regardless of the reference type
through which the method invocation occurred.</p>
<p>If a proxy interface contains a method with the same name and
parameter signature as the <code>hashCode</code>,
<code>equals</code>, or <code>toString</code> methods of
<code>java.lang.Object</code>, when such a method is invoked on a
proxy instance, the <code>Method</code> object passed to the
invocation handler will have <code>java.lang.Object</code> as its
declaring class. In other words, the public, non-final methods of
<code>java.lang.Object</code> logically precede all of the proxy
interfaces for the determination of which <code>Method</code>
object to pass to the invocation handler.</p>
<p>Note also that when a duplicate method is dispatched to an
invocation handler, the <code>invoke</code> method may only throw
checked exception types that are assignable to one of the exception
types in the <code>throws</code> clause of the method in <i>all</i>
of the proxy interfaces that it can be invoked through. If the
<code>invoke</code> method throws a checked exception that is not
assignable to any of the exception types declared by the method in
one of the proxy interfaces that it can be invoked through, then an
unchecked <code>UndeclaredThrowableException</code> will be thrown
by the invocation on the proxy instance. This restriction means
that not all of the exception types returned by invoking
<code>getExceptionTypes</code> on the <code>Method</code> object
passed to the <code>invoke</code> method can necessarily be thrown
successfully by the <code>invoke</code> method.</p>
<h2><a name="serial" id="serial">Serialization</a></h2>
<p>Since <code>java.lang.reflect.Proxy</code> implements
<code>java.io.Serializable</code>, proxy instances can be
serialized, as described in this section. If a proxy instance
contains an invocation handler that is not assignable to
<code>java.io.Serializable</code>, however, then a
<code>java.io.NotSerializableException</code> will be thrown if
such an instance is written to a
<code>java.io.ObjectOutputStream</code>. Note that for proxy
classes, implementing <code>java.io.Externalizable</code> has the
same effect with respect to serialization as implementing
<code>java.io.Serializable</code>: the <code>writeExternal</code>
and <code>readExternal</code> methods of the
<code>Externalizable</code> interface will never be invoked on a
proxy instance (or an invocation handler) as part of its
serialization process. As with all <code>Class</code> objects, the
<code>Class</code> object for a proxy class is always
serializable.</p>
<p>A proxy class has no serializable fields and a
<code>serialVersionUID</code> of <code>0L</code>. In other words,
when the <code>Class</code> object for a proxy class is passed to
the static <code>lookup</code> method of
<code>java.io.ObjectStreamClass</code>, the returned
<code>ObjectStreamClass</code> instance will have the following
properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invoking its <code>getSerialVersionUID</code> method will
return <code>0L</code>.</li>
<li>Invoking its <code>getFields</code> method will return an array
of length zero.</li>
<li>Invoking its <code>getField</code> method with any
<code>String</code> argument will return <code>null</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The stream protocol for Object Serialization supports a type
code named <code>TC_PROXYCLASSDESC</code>, which is a terminal
symbol in the grammar for the stream format; its type and value are
defined by the following constant field in the
<code>java.io.ObjectStreamConstants</code> interface:</p>
<pre>
    final static byte TC_PROXYCLASSDESC = (byte)0x7D;
</pre>
<p>The grammar also includes the following two rules, the first
being an alternate expansion of the original <i>newClassDesc</i>
rule:</p>
<p><i>newClassDesc</i>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>TC_PROXYCLASSDESC</code>
<i>newHandle</i> <i>proxyClassDescInfo</i></p>
<p><i>proxyClassDescInfo</i>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>(int)&lt;count&gt;</code>
<i>proxyInterfaceName[count]</i> <i>classAnnotation</i>
<i>superClassDesc</i></p>
<p><i>proxyInterfaceName</i>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>(utf)</code></p>
<p>When an <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> serializes the class
descriptor for a class that is a proxy class, as determined by
passing its <code>Class</code> object to the
<code>Proxy.isProxyClass</code> method, it uses the
<code>TC_PROXYCLASSDESC</code> type code instead of
<code>TC_CLASSDESC</code>, following the rules above. In the
expansion of <i>proxyClassDescInfo</i>, the sequence of
<i>proxyInterfaceName</i> items are the names of all of the
interfaces implemented by the proxy class, in the order that they
are returned by invoking the <code>getInterfaces</code> method on
the <code>Class</code> object. The <i>classAnnotation</i> and
<i>superClassDesc</i> items have the same meaning as they do in the
<i>classDescInfo</i> rule. For a proxy class, <i>superClassDesc</i>
is the class descriptor for its superclass,
<code>java.lang.reflect.Proxy</code>; including this descriptor
allows for the evolution of the serialized representation of the
class <code>Proxy</code> for proxy instances.</p>
<p>For non-proxy classes, <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> calls its
protected <code>annotateClass</code> method to allow subclasses to
write custom data to the stream for a particular class. For proxy
classes, instead of <code>annotateClass</code>, the following
method in <code>java.io.ObjectOutputStream</code> is called with
the <code>Class</code> object for the proxy class:</p>
<pre>
    protected void annotateProxyClass(Class cl) throws IOException;
</pre>
<p>The default implementation of <code>annotateProxyClass</code> in
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code> does nothing.</p>
<p>When an <code>ObjectInputStream</code> encounters the type code
<code>TC_PROXYCLASSDESC</code>, it deserializes the class
descriptor for a proxy class from the stream, formatted as
described above. Instead of calling its <code>resolveClass</code>
method to resolve the <code>Class</code> object for the class
descriptor, the following method in
<code>java.io.ObjectInputStream</code> is called:</p>
<pre>
    protected Class resolveProxyClass(String[] interfaces)
        throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
</pre>
<p>The list of interface names that were deserialized in the proxy
class descriptor are passed as the <code>interfaces</code> argument
to <code>resolveProxyClass</code>.</p>
<p>The default implementation of <code>resolveProxyClass</code> in
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> returns the results of calling
<code>Proxy.getProxyClass</code> with the list of
<code>Class</code> objects for the interfaces named in the
<code>interfaces</code> parameter. The <code>Class</code> object
used for each interface name <code>i</code> is the value retuned by
calling</p>
<pre>
        Class.forName(i, false, loader)
</pre>
where <code>loader</code> is the first non-null class loader up the
execution stack, or <code>null</code> if no non-null class loaders
are on the stack. This is the same class loader choice made by the
default behavior of the <code>resolveClass</code> method. This same
value of <code>loader</code> is also the class loader passed to
<code>Proxy.getProxyClass</code>. If
<code>Proxy.getProxyClass</code> throws an
<code>IllegalArgumentException</code>, <code>resolveClass</code>
will throw a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> containing the
<code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.
<p>Since a proxy class never has its own serializable fields, the
<i>classdata[]</i> in the stream representation of a proxy instance
consists wholly of the instance data for its superclass,
<code>java.lang.reflect.Proxy</code>. <code>Proxy</code> has one
serializable field, <code>h</code>, which contains the invocation
handler for the proxy instance.</p>
<h2><a name="examples" id="examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>Here is a simple example that prints out a message before and
after a method invocation on an object that implements an arbitrary
list of interfaces:</p>
<pre>
public interface Foo {
    Object bar(Object obj) throws BazException;
}

public class FooImpl implements Foo {
    Object bar(Object obj) throws BazException {
        // ...
    }
}

public class DebugProxy implements java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler {

    private Object obj;

    public static Object newInstance(Object obj) {
        return java.lang.reflect.Proxy.newProxyInstance(
            obj.getClass().getClassLoader(),
            obj.getClass().getInterfaces(),
            new DebugProxy(obj));
    }

    private DebugProxy(Object obj) {
        this.obj = obj;
    }

    public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method m, Object[] args)
        throws Throwable
    {
        Object result;
        try {
            System.out.println("before method " + m.getName());
            result = m.invoke(obj, args);
        } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
            throw e.getTargetException();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("unexpected invocation exception: " +
                                       e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("after method " + m.getName());
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>To construct a <code>DebugProxy</code> for an implementation of
the <code>Foo</code> interface and call one of its methods:</p>
<pre>
    Foo foo = (Foo) DebugProxy.newInstance(new FooImpl());
    foo.bar(null);
</pre>
<p>Here is an example of a utility invocation handler class that
provides default proxy behavior for methods inherited from
<code>java.lang.Object</code> and implements delegation of certain
proxy method invocations to distinct objects depending on the
interface of the invoked method:</p>
<pre>
import java.lang.reflect.*;

public class Delegator implements InvocationHandler {

    // preloaded Method objects for the methods in java.lang.Object
    private static Method hashCodeMethod;
    private static Method equalsMethod;
    private static Method toStringMethod;
    static {
        try {
            hashCodeMethod = Object.class.getMethod("hashCode", null);
            equalsMethod =
                Object.class.getMethod("equals", new Class[] { Object.class });
            toStringMethod = Object.class.getMethod("toString", null);
        } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
            throw new NoSuchMethodError(e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    private Class[] interfaces;
    private Object[] delegates;

    public Delegator(Class[] interfaces, Object[] delegates) {
        this.interfaces = (Class[]) interfaces.clone();
        this.delegates = (Object[]) delegates.clone();
    }

    public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method m, Object[] args)
        throws Throwable
    {
        Class declaringClass = m.getDeclaringClass();

        if (declaringClass == Object.class) {
            if (m.equals(hashCodeMethod)) {
                return proxyHashCode(proxy);
            } else if (m.equals(equalsMethod)) {
                return proxyEquals(proxy, args[0]);
            } else if (m.equals(toStringMethod)) {
                return proxyToString(proxy);
            } else {
                throw new InternalError(
                    "unexpected Object method dispatched: " + m);
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; interfaces.length; i++) {
                if (declaringClass.isAssignableFrom(interfaces[i])) {
                    try {
                        return m.invoke(delegates[i], args);
                    } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
                        throw e.getTargetException();
                    }
                }
            }

            return invokeNotDelegated(proxy, m, args);
        }
    }

    protected Object invokeNotDelegated(Object proxy, Method m,
                                        Object[] args)
        throws Throwable
    {
        throw new InternalError("unexpected method dispatched: " + m);
    }

    protected Integer proxyHashCode(Object proxy) {
        return new Integer(System.identityHashCode(proxy));
    }

    protected Boolean proxyEquals(Object proxy, Object other) {
        return (proxy == other ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE);
    }

    protected String proxyToString(Object proxy) {
        return proxy.getClass().getName() + '@' +
            Integer.toHexString(proxy.hashCode());
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Subclasses of <code>Delegator</code> can override
<code>invokeNotDelegated</code> to implement the behavior of proxy
method invocations not to be directly delegated to other objects,
and they can override <code>proxyHashCode</code>,
<code>proxyEquals</code>, and <code>proxyToString</code> to
override the default behavior of the methods the proxy inherits
from <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</p>
<p>To construct a <code>Delegator</code> for an implementation of
the <code>Foo</code> interface:</p>
<pre>
    Class[] proxyInterfaces = new Class[] { Foo.class };
    Foo foo = (Foo) Proxy.newProxyInstance(Foo.class.getClassLoader(),
        proxyInterfaces,
        new Delegator(proxyInterfaces, new Object[] { new FooImpl() }));
</pre>
<p>Note that the implementation of the <code>Delegator</code> class
given above is intended to be more illustrative than optimized; for
example, instead of caching and comparing the <code>Method</code>
objects for the <code>hashCode</code>, <code>equals</code>, and
<code>toString</code> methods, it could just match them by their
string names, because none of those method names are overloaded in
<code>java.lang.Object</code>.</p>
