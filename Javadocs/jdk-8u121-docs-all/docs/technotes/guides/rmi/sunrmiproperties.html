<h1><b><code>sun.rmi</code> Properties</b></h1>

<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>WARNING: The properties described here are not supported, can
change at any time, and only exist in certain implementations of the
Java Remote Method Invocation
(Java RMI). These properties are not part of
the Java RMI public API. To see a list of the properties that
<i>are</i> part of the public API, please refer to the page,
<a href="javarmiproperties.html"><code>java.rmi</code>
Properties</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Please Note</b>: Unless otherwise stated, any output from
these properties is sent to <code>System.err</code>.</p>
<p>Each of the properties that have names ending in
"<code>.logLevel</code>" have possible values of
"<code>SILENT</code>", "<code>BRIEF</code>", and
"<code>VERBOSE</code>". These values are case insensitive and may
be abbreviated as a string containing the first <i>n</i> letters,
where <i>n</i> is greater than or equal to 1. If not specified,
these properties have a default value of "<code>SILENT</code>". A
value of <code>"BRIEF"</code> causes the corresponding <a href=
"logging.html"><code>Logger</code></a> to be set to the level
<code>Level.FINE</code>, and a value of <code>"VERBOSE"</code>
causes the corresponding <code>Logger</code> to be set to the level
<code>Level.FINER</code>. Use of the logging configuration file is
now preferred over the use of these <code>sun.rmi.*</code> system
properties for logging.</p>
<p>Logging messages are sent to <code>System.err</code>. For
instance, if a property is said to send output to the "transport"
log, this means that logging messages are sent to a
<code>LogStream</code> returned by
<code>java.rmi.server.LogStream.log("transport")</code>, which
sends messages to <code>System.err</code>, unless you've set it to
something else.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Properties that can be set on <code>rmid</code></h2>
<dl>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property controls the policy that
<code>rmid</code> uses to determine whether or not the information
in an <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> may be used to launch a
virtual machine for an activation group. The possible values for
the property are <code>default</code>, <code>none</code>, or the
fully qualified name of a class that implements a method named
<code>checkExecCommand</code> that is called to verify
<code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> information. For details, see the
tools documentation for <code>rmid</code> [<a href=
"../../tools/unix/rmid.html">Solaris, Linux, or Mac OS X</a>] [<a href=
"../../tools/windows/rmid.html">Windows</a>].</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.activation.execTimeout</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the time (in
milliseconds) that the activation system will wait for a spawned
activation group to start up. Setting this property gives you the
ability to shorten or lengthen the maximum time that
<code>rmid</code> will wait for an activation group to start up.
The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.activation.groupThrottle</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the maximum number of
activation group VMs that <code>rmid</code> will allow to be in the
"spawning but not yet active" state simultaneously. If more VMs
need to be started, they will queue up until one of the current
spawn attempts either succeeds or times out. Note that this
property does not limit the maximum number of active VMs; it is
intended to smooth out sudden spikes of activity to avoid reaching
operating system limits. While setting the value of this property
to a lower number may result in a longer start-up time for
<code>rmid</code>, and setting the value to a higher number could
shorten the start-up time, setting this value too high can crash
<code>rmid</code>, because your system may run out of resources.
The default value is 3. In previous releases, this property was
named <code>sun.rmi.rmid.maxstartgroup</code> which is no longer
supported.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.activation.groupTimeout</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the time (in
milliseconds) that <code>rmid</code> will wait after destroying an
activation group's process before creating a new incarnation of the
activation group. The default value is 60000 milliseconds (60
seconds).</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.activation.snapshotInterval</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property controls the number of updates for which the
activation system will wait before it serializes a snapshot of its
state to the <code>rmid</code> log file on disk. An "update" refers
to a persistent change in the state of the activation system (for
example, the registration of an <code>Activatable</code> object)
since the last snapshot was taken. Changing the value of this
property can be used to make <code>rmid</code> re-start more
quickly (by taking snapshots of the log more often) or to make
<code>rmid</code> more efficient (by taking snapshots of the log
less often). The value of this property is a positive integer
value. The default value is 200.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.log.debug</code></b></dt>
<dd>If this value is <code>true</code>, details of
<code>rmid</code>'s logging activity are sent to
<code>System.err</code>.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.server.activation.debugExec</code></b></dt>
<dd>If this value is <code>true</code>, the activation system will
print out debugging information to the command line that is used
for spawning activation groups. By default, the value is
<code>false</code>, so debugging information is not printed.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Properties that are useful to set on VMs that export remote
objects</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.ackTimeout</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the length of time (in
milliseconds) that the server-side Java RMI runtime will strongly
refer to a remote object (or a reference to a remote object) that
has been returned from the current virtual machine as part of the
result of a remote method call, until it receives positive
acknowledgment from the client that the remote reference has been
fully received and processed. This timeout only applies to failure
situations (in which the client fails to send the acknowledgment).
Setting the value too low can increase the risk of a remote object
being prematurely garbage collected when the only known reference
to the remote object is the one in transit as part of the remote
method call result. The maximum value is
<code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code>. The default value is 300000 (five
minutes).</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.checkInterval</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents (in milliseconds) how
often the Java RMI runtime checks for expired DGC leases. The
default value is half the value of the <a href=
"javarmiproperties.html#leaseValue"><code><b>java.rmi.dgc.leaseValue</b></code></a>
property.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.logLevel</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property controls the logging of incoming and outgoing
calls related to DGC lease granting, renewing, and expiration. It
sends output to the "dgc" log.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval</code></b></dt>
<dd>When it is necessary to ensure that unreachable remote objects
are unexported and garbage collected in a timely fashion, the value
of this property represents the maximum interval (in milliseconds)
that the Java RMI runtime will allow between garbage collections of
the local heap. The default value is 3600000 milliseconds (one
hour).</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.loader.logLevel</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property controls the logging of each class name and
codebase, whenever the Java RMI runtime attempts to load a class as
a result of unmarshalling either an argument or return value. This
property sends output to the "loader" log.</dd>
<dd>
<p><a name="et" id="et"></a></p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.server.exceptionTrace</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property controls the output of server-side stack traces
from exceptions and errors that are thrown by dispatched, incoming
remote calls. If this value is <code>true</code>, exception stack
traces will be printed. By default (<code>false</code>), exception
and error stack traces are not printed.</dd>
<dd>
<p><a name="suppressStackTraces" id="suppressStackTraces"></a></p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.server.suppressStackTraces</code></b></dt>
<dd>If this value is <code>true</code>, the server-side Java RMI
runtime implementation will clear the stack traces of all
exceptions thrown from the current virtual machine as the result of
remote calls. This property is useful for certain server
applications that may wish to prevent any server-side stack trace
data from accompanying an exception to be marshalled out as the
result of an incoming remote call, perhaps for reasons of
performance or confidentiality.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.logLevel</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property controls detailed logging throughout the
transport layer. It sends output to the "transport" log.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.localHostNameTimeOut</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the time (in
milliseconds) that the Java RMI runtime will wait to obtain a fully
qualified domain name for the local host. The default value is
10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.logLevel</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property provides detailed logging for the TCP-specific
transport sub-layer. It sends output to the "tcp" log.</dd>
<dd>
<p><a name="readTimeout" id="readTimeout"></a></p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.readTimeout</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the time (in
milliseconds) used as an idle timeout for incoming TCP connections
the Java RMI runtime uses. The value is passed to
<code>java.net.Socket.setSoTimeout</code>. This property is used
only for cases where a client has not dropped an unused connection
as it should (see <a href=
"#connectionTimeout"><i><code>sun.rmi.transport.connectionTimeout</code></i></a>).
The default value is 2*3600*1000 milliseconds (two hours).</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.maxConnectionThreads</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property controls the maximum size of the
pool of threads used to handle incoming connections, and thus it
places an upper bound on the number of incoming remote method
invocations that can execute concurrently. Setting this property to
a lower value may improve the throughput of a Java RMI server
application under heavy load, but setting it too low may (depending
on the nature of the application's remote invocation patterns) lead
to deadlock or starvation. The default value is the maximum,
<code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>, which effectively means no
limit.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.threadKeepAliveTime</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property controls the amount of time that a
thread in the pool of threads used to handle incoming connections
will remain idle before terminating. The default value is 60000
milliseconds (one minute).</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Properties that are useful to set on VMs that make remote
method calls</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.client.logCalls</code></b></dt>
<dd>If the value of this property is <code>true</code>, the
<code>sun.rmi.client.call</code> logger will be set to the level
<code>Level.FINER</code>. Remote calls are logged at the level
<code>Level.FINER</code>, and exceptions from remote calls are
logged at the level <code>Level.FINE</code>.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.cleanInterval</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the maximum length of
time (in milliseconds) that the Java RMI runtime will wait before
retrying a failed DGC "clean" call. The default value is 180000
milliseconds (three minutes).</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval</code></b></dt>
<dd>When it is necessary to ensure that DGC clean calls for
unreachable remote references are delivered in a timely fashion,
the value of this property represents the maximum interval (in
milliseconds) that the Java RMI runtime will allow between garbage
collections of the local heap. The default value is 3600000
milliseconds (one hour).</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.loader.logLevel</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property controls the logging of each class name and
codebase, whenever the Java RMI runtime attempts to load a class as
a result of unmarshalling either an argument or return value. This
property sends output to the "loader" log.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.server.logLevel</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property controls the logging of information related to
outgoing calls, including some connection-reuse information. It
sends output to the "transport" log.</dd>
<dd>
<p><a name="connectionTimeout" id="connectionTimeout"></a></p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.connectionTimeout</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the period (in
milliseconds) for which socket connections may reside in an
"unused" state, before the Java RMI runtime will allow those
connections to be freed (closed). The default value is 15000
milliseconds (15 seconds). See also <a href=
"#readTimeout"><i><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.readTimeout</code></i></a>.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.logLevel</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property controls detailed logging throughout the
transport layer. It sends output to the "transport" log.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.proxy.connectTimeout</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the maximum length of
time (in milliseconds) that the Java RMI runtime will wait for a
connection attempt (<code>createSocket</code>) to complete, before
attempting to contact the server using HTTP. This property is only
used when the <code>http.proxyHost</code> property is set and the
value of <code>java.rmi.server.disableHttp</code> is
<code>false</code>. The default value is 15000 milliseconds (15
seconds).</dd>
<dd>
<p><a name="eagerHttpFallback" id="eagerHttpFallback"></a></p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.proxy.eagerHttpFallback</code></b></dt>
<dd>If this value is true and the <a href=
"javarmiproperties.html#disableHttp"><code><b>java.rmi.server.disableHttp</b></code></a>
system property is not set, then the default global
<code>RMISocketFactory</code> will fall back to HTTP tunneling when
any <code>java.net.SocketException</code> is thrown from an initial
(direct) connection attempt, as opposed to the default behavior of
falling back to HTTP tunneling only if an initial connection
attempt throws a <code>java.net.UnknownHostException</code> or
<code>java.net.NoRouteToHostException</code>.
<p>This setting can be useful when dealing with firewalls that deny
(instead of ignore) connection attempts to unauthorized ports,
resulting in <code>java.net.ConnectionException</code>s inside the
client's default global <code>RMISocketFactory</code>. If this
system property is not enabled, then such
<code>ConnectionException</code>s will not trigger HTTP fallback,
since they are neither <code>UnknownHostException</code>s nor
<code>NoRouteToHostException</code>s. However, if this system
property is enabled, then the <code>ConnectionException</code>s
will cause HTTP fallback to occur, because
<code>ConnectionException</code> is a subclass of
<code>SocketException</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.proxy.logLevel</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property controls the logging of events
(<code>createSocket</code> and <code>createServerSocket</code>)
when the default <code>RMISocketFactory</code> class is used. This
type of logging is likely to be useful for applications that use
Java RMI over HTTP. Events in custom socket factories are not
logged by this property. It sends some messages to the "proxy" log,
and others to the "transport" log.</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.handshakeTimeout</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the length of time (in
milliseconds) that the client-side Java RMI runtime will use as a
socket read timeout when reading initial handshake data (protocol
acknowledgment) when establishing a new JRMP connection. This
property is used to configure how long the Java RMI runtime will
wait before deciding that a TCP connection accepted by a remote
server cannot actually be used, either because the entity listening
on the remote host's port is not actually a Java RMI server, or
because the server is somehow not functioning correctly. The
maximum value is <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>, and a value of
zero indicates an infinite timeout. The default value is 60000 (one
minute).</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.responseTimeout</code></b></dt>
<dd>The value of this property represents the length of time (in
milliseconds) that the client-side Java RMI runtime will use as a
socket read timeout on an established JRMP connection when reading
response data for a remote method invocation. Therefore, this
property can be used to impose a timeout on waiting for the results
of remote invocations; if this timeout expires, the associated
invocation will fail with a <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code>.
Setting this property should be done with due consideration,
however, because it effectively places an upper bound on the
allowed duration of any successful outgoing remote invocation. The
maximum value is <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>, and a value of
zero indicates an infinite timeout. The default value is zero (no
timeout).</dd>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.logLevel</code></b></dt>
<dd>This property provides detailed logging for the TCP-specific
transport sub-layer. It sends output to the "tcp" log.</dd>
