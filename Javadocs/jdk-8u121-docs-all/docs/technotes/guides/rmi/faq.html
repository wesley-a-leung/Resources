<h2>Java RMI</h2>
<h3><a name="domain" id="domain">A.1 Why do I get an exception for
an unexpected hostname and/or port number when I call
<code>Naming.lookup</code>?</a></h3>
The hostname and port number you see in the exception trace
represent the address on which the looked-up server believes it is
listening. While the Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI)
server can theoretically be on any host, it is usually the same
host as that on which the registry is running, and on a different
port.
<p>Even if the server is mistaken about its hostname or IP address
(or has a hostname that simply isn't resolvable by clients), it
will still export all of its objects using that mistaken hostname,
but you will see an exception every time you try to receive one of
those objects.</p>
<p>The hostname which you specified in <code>Naming.lookup</code>
to locate the registry has no effect on the hostname which is
already embedded in the remote reference to the server.</p>
<p>Usually, the mysterious hostname is the unqualified hostname of
the server, or a private name unknown to the client's nameservice,
or (in the case of Windows platforms) the server's
Network-&gt;Identification-&gt;Machine Name.</p>
<p>The appropriate workaround is to set the system property
<code>java.rmi.server.hostname</code> when starting the server. The
value of the property should be the externally reachable hostname
(or IP address) of the server -- whatever works when specified as
the host-part in <code>Naming.lookup</code> is good enough.</p>
<p>For more detail, see the questions on <a href=
"#netunknownhost">callbacks</a> and <a href="#netfqdn">fully
qualified domain names</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="codebase" id="codebase">A.2 Do I have to install the
<code>_Stub</code> file in the client's <code>CLASSPATH</code>? I
thought it could be downloaded.</a></h3>
A stub class can be downloaded, if the server that is exporting the
remote object annotates the marshalled stub instance with the
<code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property, which indicates the
location from where the stub class can be loaded. You should set
the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property on the server
exporting a remote object. While remote clients could set this
property, they would then be limited to only getting remote objects
from the specified codebase. You should not assume that any client
VM will have specified a codebase that resolves to the location of
your object.
<p>When a remote object is marshalled by Java RMI (whether as an
argument to a remote call or as a return value), the codebase for
the stub class is retrieved by Java RMI and used to annotate the
serialized stub. When the stub is unmarshalled, the codebase is
used to load the stub classfile using the
<code>RMIClassLoader</code>, <em>unless</em> the class can already
be found in the <code>CLASSPATH</code> or by the context
classloader for the receiving object, such as an applet
codebase.</p>
<p>If the <code>_Stub</code> class was loaded by an
<code>RMIClassLoader</code>, then Java RMI already knows which
codebase to use for its annotation. If the <code>_Stub</code> class
was loaded from the <code>CLASSPATH</code>, then there is no
obvious codebase, and Java RMI consults the
<code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> system property to find the
codebase. If the system property is not set, then the stub is
marshalled with a null codebase, which means that it cannot be used
unless the client has a matching copy of the <code>_Stub</code>
classfile in the client's <code>CLASSPATH</code>.</p>
<p>It is easy to forget to specify the codebase property. One way
to detect this error is to start the <code>rmiregistry</code>
separately and without access to the application classes. This will
force <code>Naming.rebind</code> to fail if the codebase is
omitted.</p>
<p>For more information on the
<code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property, please take a look
at our tutorial, <i><a href="codebase.html">Dynamic code
downloading using Java RMI (Using the
<code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> Property)</a></i>.</p>
<h3><a name="classserver" id="classserver">A.3 Does Java RMI
require me to use an HTTP server?</a></h3>
<p>No. You can set your <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property
to use any valid URL protocol, such as <code>file</code> or
<code>ftp</code>. Using an HTTP server just makes your life simpler
by providing an automated mechanism for class file downloading.</p>
<h3><a name="wrongcodebase" id="wrongcodebase">A.4 Why am I getting
a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>?</a></h3>
Most likely the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property has
not been set (or has not been set correctly) on a VM that is
exporting your remote object(s). Please take a look at our
tutorial, <i><a href="codebase.html">Dynamic code downloading using
Java RMI (Using the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code>
Property)</a></i>.
<h3><a name="customsocketreuse" id="customsocketreuse">A.5 Why does
the Java RMI implementation create so many sockets when my
application uses custom socket factories; or why are stubs (using a
custom socket factory) that refer to the same remote object not
equal; or why does the Java RMI implementation not reuse
server-side ports when I use a custom server socket
factory?</a></h3>
The Java RMI implementation attempts to reuse open sockets where
possible for remote invocations. When a remote method is invoked on
a stub that uses a custom socket factory, the Java RMI
implementation will reuse an open connection (if any) as long as
that socket was created by an equivalent socket factory. Since
client socket factories are serialized to clients, a single client
may have several distinct copies of the same logical socket
factory. To ensure that the Java RMI implementation will reuse
sockets created by custom socket factories, make sure your custom
client socket factory classes implement the <code>hashCode</code>
and <code>equals</code> methods appropriately. If the client socket
factory does not implement these methods correctly, another
ramification is that stubs (using the client socket factory) that
refer to the same remote object will not be equal.
<p>The Java RMI implementation attempts to reuse server-side ports
as well. It will only do so if there is an existing server socket
for the port created by an equivalent socket factory. Make sure the
server socket factory class implements the <code>hashCode</code>
and <code>equals</code> methods too.</p>
<p>If your socket factory has no instance state, a trivial
implementation of the <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code>
methods are the following:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    public int hashCode() { return 57; }
    public boolean equals(Object o) { return this.getClass() == o.getClass() }
</pre>
<h3><a name="debug" id="debug">B.1 Will there be debugging
mechanisms built into Java RMI?</a></h3>
Java RMI supports a simple call-logging facility for debugging. But
there are no current plans to support a full-featured, interactive,
remote debugger.
<h3><a name="debugwin" id="debugwin">B.2 I am having a problem
debugging my program on Windows 95. Any suggestions?</a></h3>
The <code>javaw</code> command throws away output to
<code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>, so for debugging
purposes it is better to run the <code>java</code> command in a
separate window so that you can see reported errors. To do this,
execute a command like the following:
<pre class="codeblock">
        start java EchoImpl
</pre>
<p>It is advised not to use the <code>javaw</code> command during
development. To watch the server activity, start the server with
<code>-Djava.rmi.server.logCalls=true</code>.</p>
<h3><a name="mismatch" id="mismatch">B.3 Why do I get a
<code>java.lang.ClassMismatchError</code> while running my
program?</a></h3>
You probably modified one or more classes that were being used by
Java RMI programs while your program was running. Try restarting
all Java RMI applications (including
<code>java.rmi.registry.RegistryImpl</code>). This should clear
things up.
<h3><a name="array" id="array">B.4 I am sending an array of remote
objects and receive an <code>ArrayStoreException</code>. What's
going on?</a></h3>
Java RMI replaces the remote objects with the stub and therefore
the type of the array must be that of the interface. The code would
look like:
<pre class="codeblock">
   FooRemote[] f = new FooRemote[10];
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; f.length; i++) {
      f[i] = new FooRemoteImpl();
   }
</pre>
<p>Now Java RMI can put the stub into each cell of the array
without an exception on the remote call.</p>
<h3><a name="deadlock" id="deadlock">B.5 I have local objects that
are synchronized. When I make them remote, my application hangs.
What's the problem?</a></h3>
What you encountered was distributed deadlock. In the local VM
case, the VM can tell that the calling object "A" owns the lock and
will allow the call back to "A" to proceed. In the distributed
case, no such determination can be made, so the result is deadlock.
<p>Distributed objects behave differently than local objects. If
you simply reuse a local implementation without handling locking
and failure, you will probably get unpredictable results.</p>
<h3><a name="regpath" id="regpath">B.6 I am getting a
<code>ClassNotFoundException</code> for my stub class when I try to
register a remote object in the registry. What's
happening?</a></h3>
<p>When you make a call to the registry to bind an object, the
registry actually binds a reference to the stub for the remote
object. In order to instantiate a stub object, the registry VM
needs to be able to load its class definition. The VM (in this case
the server VM) that sends the serialized forms of a stub in a
remote method call to the registry is responsible for annotating
the stub with the location from which its classes can be
downloaded. If stubs are not annotated properly, Java RMI will
throw a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> when it tries to
instantiate the stub.</p>
<p>To annotate classes properly, the server needs to set the value
of the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property value to the
location(s) of the stub classes. Java RMI will automatically
annotate the serialized form of outgoing object instances with the
value of the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property.</p>
<p>NOTE: It is possible (and in a small number of environments
appropriate) to enable the <tt>rmiregistry</tt> to unmarshal stub
objects by placing all relevant stub class files in the CLASSPATH
of the <tt>rmiregistry</tt>. However, the <tt>rmiregistry</tt> does
not have to download stub classes. If stub classes are available
locally, it will use those classes. Using the
<tt>rmiregistry</tt>'s CLASSPATH for stub deployment requires that
all VMs that reference a stub instance obtained from that registry
have the stub's class file installed locally (in the VM's
CLASSPATH).</p>
<p>For example, if the registry loads stub classes from its
CLASSPATH, when the registry sends serialized stub objects to other
VMs, those serialized objects will be annotated with the value of
the registry's <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property
(which will almost always be null). If the VMs receiving serialized
stub objects from the registry do not have the class files for
those stubs installed locally then those VMs are likely to throw a
<code>ClassNotFoundException</code>.</p>
<p>Instead, if classes are downloaded dynamically from a server
VM's <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> annotation, only the
<i>server</i> VM needs to have the stub classes in its CLASSPATH.
With this approach, application deployment is simpler and it is
possible to introduce new stub versions into a running distributed
system.</p>
<p>For more information on dynamic code downloading in Java RMI,
please see the tutorial, <i><a href="codebase.html">Dynamic code
downloading using Java RMI (Using the
<code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code>)</a></i>.</p>
<h3><a name="serverdied" id="serverdied">B.7 My server died. Can I
get a trace of the server activity?</a></h3>
To get a trace of the server activity, start the server as follows:
<pre class="codeblock">
    java -Djava.rmi.server.logCalls=true YourServerImpl
</pre>
where <code>YourServerImpl</code> is the name of your server. If
your server has hung, you can get a monitor dump and thread dump by
doing a <tt>ctrl-\</tt> on the Solaris Operating System
(Solaris OS) and a <tt>ctrl-break</tt> on Windows platforms.
<h3><a name="properties" id="properties">B.8 Where can I find a
list of system properties that might be useful for implementing and
debugging Java RMI applications?</a></h3>
<a href="javarmiproperties.html">Properties that begin with
<b>"<code>java.rmi.</code>"</b></a> are elements of the public
specification and are documented in the <a href=
"../../../platform/rmi/spec/rmiTOC.html"><i>Java RMI
Specification</i></a>.
<p><a href="sunrmiproperties.html">Properties that begin with
<b>"<code>sun.rmi.</code>"</b></a> are only supported by certain
versions of the JDK. While these <b>"<code>sun.rmi.*</code>"</b>
properties can be quite useful for debugging and tuning at runtime,
please note that they are not considered part of the public API,
and their use is subject to change (or may be removed completely)
in future versions of the implementation.</p>
<h3><a name="netcontact" id="netcontact">C.1 How do Java RMI
clients contact remote Java RMI servers?</a></h3>
<img src="images/faqArt1-1.gif" height="366" width="443" align=
"left" alt=
"Illustrates the means by which Java RMI clients contact remote Java RMI servers, as discussed below." />
<p>For an Java RMI client to contact a remote Java RMI server, the
client must first hold a reference to the server. The
<code>Naming.lookup</code> method call is the most common mechanism
by which clients initially obtain references to remote servers.
Remote references may be obtained by other means, for example: all
remote method calls can return remote references. This is what
<code>Naming.lookup</code> does; it uses a well-known stub to make
a remote method call to the <code>rmiregistry</code>, which sends
back the remote reference to the object requested by the
<code>lookup</code> method.</p>
<p>Every remote reference contains a server hostname and port
number that allow clients to locate the VM that is serving a
particular remote object. Once a Java RMI client has a remote
reference, the client will use the hostname and port provided in
the reference to open a socket connection to the remote server.</p>
<p>Please note that with Java RMI the terms <i>client</i> and
<i>server</i> can refer to the same program. A Java program that
acts as a Java RMI server contains an exported remote object. A
Java RMI client is a program that invokes one or more methods on a
remote object in another virtual machine. If a VM performs both of
these functions, it may be referred to as an RMI client and a Java
RMI server.</p>
<h3><a name="netunknownhost" id="netunknownhost">C.2 Why does my
remote method or "callback" routine fail with a nested
<code>java.net.UnknownHostException</code>?</a></h3>
<p>Java RMI may default to using an unresolvable server hostname (for
example: unqualified names, Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)
names, or unqualified DHCP names). When a Java RMI client invokes a
remote method using a reference that contains an unresolvable
server hostname, the client will throw an
<code>UnknownHostException</code>.</p>
<p>In order to generate functional remote references, Java RMI
servers must be able to supply a fully qualified hostname or IP
address that is resolvable from all Java RMI clients (an example of
a fully qualified hostname is <samp>foo.bar.com</samp>). If a Java
RMI program provides a remote callback operation, then that program
serves a Java RMI object and consequently, must be able to
determine a resolvable hostname to use as its server hostname in
the remote references it passes to Java RMI clients. VMs that make
calls to applets that serve remote objects may throw
<code>UnknownHostException</code>s because the applet has failed to
provide a usable server hostname.</p>
<p>If your Java RMI application throws an
<code>UnknownHostException</code>, you can look at the resulting
stack trace to see if the hostname that the client is using to
contact its remote server is incorrect or not fully qualified. If
necessary, you can set the <code>java.rmi.server.hostname</code>
property on the server to the correct IP address or hostname of the
server machine and Java RMI will use this property's value to
generate remote references to the server.</p>
<h3><a name="netfqdn" id="netfqdn">C.3 My server <em>is</em> using
a fully qualified domain name or IP address, so why do I still get
an <code>UnknownHostException</code>?</a></h3>
Depending on the configuration of your network's name service, a
fully qualified hostname that is recognized on one Java RMI host
may not be resolvable from another Java RMI host. Some examples
where this situation may arise are:
<ul>
<li>Misconfigured DHCP servers may set the fully qualified domain
name of Java RMI server machines to be the domain name of the
resolver domain instead of the domain in which the Java RMI server
actually resides. In this case, Java RMI clients outside the
server's DHCP domain will be unable to contact the server, because
of its incorrect domain name.</li>
<li>The server machine is on a network that is configured to use
WINS. Hosts that are only registered under WINS may not be
reachable by hosts that rely solely upon DNS.</li>
<li>The Java RMI client and server reside on opposite sides of a
firewall. If your Java RMI client lies outside a firewall and the
server resides inside it, the client will not be able to make any
remote calls to the server. If the Java RMI client lies inside the
firewall, you will need to <i><a href=
"../../../platform/rmi/spec/rmi-arch6.html">configure the Java RMI
client</a></i> to contact the server using HTTP.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="netmultihomed" id="netmultihomed">C.4 I am using the
latest release of the JDK and I have a host that has multiple IP
addresses. Java RMI is choosing the wrong IP address for its server
hostname. How do I work around this problem?</a></h3>
Set the <code>java.rmi.server.hostname</code> property to the
correct IP address of the Java RMI server machine. You can also
specify that your server use a fully qualified hostname obtained
from a name service by setting the property:
<pre class="codeblock">
    java.rmi.server.useLocalHostname=true
</pre>
<h3><a name="nethostname" id="nethostname">C.5 How does Java RMI
obtain a server hostname?</a></h3>
<p>Java RMI will use an IP address or a fully qualified domain name
to identify a machine that serves a remote object. Server hostnames
are initialized to the value obtained by performing the following
actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>By default, Java RMI uses the IP address of the server host as
the server name for remote references.</li>
<li>If the property <code>java.rmi.server.hostname</code> is set,
Java RMI will use its value as the server hostname, and will not
attempt to find a fully qualified domain name through any other
method. This property takes precedence over all other means of
finding a Java RMI server name.</li>
<li>If the property <code>java.rmi.server.useLocalHostname</code>
is set to <code>true</code> (by default, the value of this property
is <code>false</code>), Java RMI applies the following routine to
obtain a hostname for the Java RMI server:
<ol>
<li>If the value returned by the
<code>InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()</code> method
contains a "." character, then Java RMI will assume that this value
is the server's fully qualified domain name and will use it as the
server hostname.</li>
<li>Otherwise, Java RMI will spawn a thread to query the local name
service for the fully qualified domain name of the Java RMI server.
If the name service takes too long to return, or the name service
returns but its response does not contain a "." then Java RMI will
use the server's IP address obtained from
<code>InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress()</code>.</li>
</ol>
Users can override the default time (10 seconds or 10000
milliseconds) that Java RMI will look for a fully qualified domain
name by setting the following property:<br />
<code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.localHostnameTimeOut</code>=<i>timeOutMillis</i><br />

where <i>timeOutMillis</i> is the time that Java RMI will wait in
milliseconds. For example:
<pre class="codeblock">
            java -Dsun.rmi.transport.tcp.localHostnameTimeOut=2000 MyServerApp
        
</pre></li>
</ol>
When using activatable remote objects, it is recommended that Java
RMI servers set the value of the
<code>java.rmi.server.useLocalHostname</code> property to
<code>true</code>. In general, hostnames are more stable than IP
addresses. Activatable remote objects tend to last longer than
transient remote objects (for example,&nbsp; surviving a reboot). A
Java RMI client will be more likely to locate a remote object over
a long period of time if it uses a qualified hostname rather than
an explicit IP address.
<h3><a name="bind" id="bind">C.6 Why do <code>Naming.bind</code>
and <code>Naming.lookup</code> take an extraordinarily long time on
Windows platforms?</a></h3>
Most likely, your host's networking setup is incorrect. Java RMI
uses the Java API networking classes, in particular
<code>java.net.InetAddress</code>, which will cause TCP/IP host
name lookups - both host to address mapping and address to hostname
mapping (the <code>InetAddress</code> class does this for security
reasons). On Windows platforms, the lookup functions are performed
by the native socket library, so the delays are happening not in
Java RMI, but in the libraries. If your host is set up to use DNS,
then it is usually a problem with the DNS server not knowing about
the hosts involved in communication, and what you are experiencing
are DNS lookup timeouts. Try specifying all the involved
hostnames/addresses in the local file
<code>\winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</code> or
<code>\windows\hosts</code>. The format of a typical host file is:
<pre class="codeblock">
    IPAddress     Machine Name
</pre>
e.g.:
<pre class="codeblock">
    192.0.2.61   homer
</pre>
This should dramatically cut down the time it takes to make the
first lookup.
<h3><a name="standalone" id="standalone">C.7 How do I use Java RMI
on a Windows 95 standalone machine, not connected to the
network?</a></h3>
To get Java RMI working on a Windows 95 machine that is not on a
network, TCP/IP must be configured. One way to accomplish this is
to configure an unused COM port as a dedicated PPP or SLIP
connection. Then disable DHCP and manually configure an IP address
(e.g. <code>192.168.1.1</code>). You should then find that from a
DOS Shell, you can ping yourself (for example, <kbd>ping</kbd>
<var>mymachine</var>). You should now be able to use Java RMI on
the machine.
<h3><a name="addrinuse" id="addrinuse">C.8 Why do I get the
exception "<code>java.net.SocketException: Address already in
use</code>" when I try to run the registry?</a></h3>
This exception means that the port that the
<code>RegistryImpl</code> uses (by default 1099) is already in use.
You may have another registry running on your machine and will need
to stop it.
<h3><a name="firewall" id="firewall">C.9 How can I use Java RMI
through a firewall?</a></h3>
It depends on whether you need to traverse a firewall for <a href=
"#firewallOut">outgoing calls</a> or for <a href=
"#firewallIn">incoming calls</a>.
<h3><a name="firewallOut" id="firewallOut">C.10 How can I make
outgoing Java RMI calls through a local firewall?</a></h3>
There are three main methods: HTTP tunnelling, SOCKS, and
downloaded socket factories.
<h4>HTTP tunnelling</h4>
This well-worn method is popular since it requires almost no setup,
and works quite well in firewalled environments which permit you to
handle HTTP through a proxy, but disallow regular outbound TCP
connections.
<p>If Java RMI fails to make a normal (or SOCKS) connection to the
intended server, and it notices that a HTTP proxy server is
configured, it will attempt to tunnel Java RMI requests through
that proxy server, one at a time.</p>
<p>There are two forms of HTTP tunnelling, tried in order. The
first is <em>http-to-port</em>; the second is
<em>http-to-cgi</em>.</p>
<p>In http-to-port tunneling, Java RMI attempts a HTTP POST request
to a <code>http:</code> URL directed at the exact hostname and port
number of the target server. The HTTP request contains a single
Java RMI request. If the HTTP proxy accepts this URL, it will
forward the POST request to the listening Java RMI server, which
will recognize the request and unwrap it. The result of the call is
wrapped in a HTTP reply, which is returned through the same
proxy.</p>
<p>Often, HTTP proxies will refuse to proxy requests to unusual
port numbers. In this case, Java RMI will fall back to http-to-cgi
tunneling. The Java RMI request is encapsulated in a HTTP POST
request as before, but the request URL is of the form
<code>http://<em>hostname</em>:80/cgi-bin/java-rmi.cgi?port=<em>n</em></code>
(where <em>hostname</em> and <em>n</em> are the hostname and port
number of the intended server). There must be a HTTP server
listening on port 80 on the server host, which will run the
<code>java-rmi.cgi</code> script (supplied with the JDK), which
will in turn forward the request to a Java RMI server listening on
port <em>n</em>. Java RMI can unwrap a HTTP-tunneled request
without help from a http server, CGI script, or any other external
entity. So, if the client's HTTP proxy can connect directly to the
server's port, then you don't need a <code>java-rmi.cgi</code>
script at all.</p>
<p>To trigger the use of HTTP tunneling, the standard system
property <code>http.proxyHost</code> must be set to the hostname of
the local HTTP proxy. (There are reports that some Navigator
versions do not set this property.)</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of HTTP tunneling is that it does not
permit inward calls or multiplexed connections. A secondary
disadvantage is that the http-to-cgi method opens a dramatic
security hole on the server side, since without modification it
will redirect any incoming request to any port.</p>
<h4>SOCKS</h4>
The default implementation of sockets in the JDK will use a
<i><a href="http://ss5.sourceforge.net/">SOCKS server</a></i> if
available and configured. The system property
<code>socksProxyHost</code> must have been set to the hostname of
the SOCKS server; if the port number of the SOCKS server is not
1080, it must be specified in the <code>socksProxyPort</code>
property.
<p>This approach would appear to be the most generally useful
solution. As yet, <code>ServerSockets</code> do not use SOCKS, so
incoming calls must use another mechanism.</p>
<h4>Downloaded socket factories</h4>
This allows the server to specify
the socket factory that the clients must use. See the tutorial <i><a href=
"socketfactory/index.html">Using Custom Socket Factories with Java
RMI</a></i> for details.
<p>The disadvantage of this approach is that the traversal of the
firewall must be done by code provided by the Java RMI server side,
which does not necessarily know how that traversal must be done,
nor does it automatically have sufficient privilege to traverse the
firewall.</p>
<h3><a name="firewallIn" id="firewallIn">C.11 How can I receive
incoming Java RMI calls through a local firewall?</a></h3>
There are three main methods: known ports, transport-level bridges,
and application-level proxies.
<h4>Known Ports</h4>
<p>If the exported objects are all exported on a known port on a known
host, then that host and port can be explicitly permitted at the
firewall. Normally, Java RMI asks for port 0 (which is code for
"any port"). In the JDK, there is an extra argument to the
<code>exportObject</code> method to specify the exact port number.</p>
<p>This approach has the disadvantage that it requires the
assistance of the network administrator responsible for the local
firewall. If the exported object is being run in a different
location (because code was downloaded to that site), then the local
firewall may be run by network administrators who don't know who
you are.</p>
<h4>Transport-level bridges</h4>
A transport-level bridge is a program that reads bytes from one TCP
connection and writes them to another (and vice versa) without
knowing or caring what the bytes represent.
<p>The idea here is to export objects in such a way that anyone
outside the firewall who wants to call remote methods on that
object instead contacts a different port (perhaps on a different
machine). That different port has a running program which makes a
second connection to the real server and then pumps bytes each
way.</p>
<p>The tricky part is convincing the client to connect to the
bridge. A downloadable socket factory can do
this efficiently; otherwise, it is possible to set the
<code>java.rmi.server.hostname</code> property to name the bridge
host and arrange for port numbers to be the same.</p>
<h4>Application-level proxies</h4>
This approach is quite a bit of work, but leads to a very secure
arrangement. A proxy program runs on a firewall host (one which can
be accessed from outside as well as inside). When an internal
server intends to make an exported object available to the world,
it contacts the proxy server and gives it a remote reference. The
proxy server creates a proxy object (a new remote object residing
in the proxy server) which implements the same remote interfaces as
the original. The proxy server returns a remote reference for the
new proxy object to the internal server, which communicates it to
the outside world (somehow).
<p>When an outsider makes a call on the proxy, the proxy
immediately forwards the call to its original object on the
internal server. The use of the proxy is transparent to the
outsider (but not to the internal server, who has to decide whether
to pass the original reference or the proxy reference when talking
to anyone).</p>
<p>Needless to say, this requires considerable setup and the
cooperation of the local network administrators.</p>
<h3><a name="firewallBoth" id="firewallBoth">C.12 So what do I have
to do to get Java RMI to operate through two firewalls?</a></h3>
First of all, what cooperation can you expect from the client-side
firewall?
<p>In the most pessimistic case, the client-side firewall allows
<em>no</em> direct TCP connections and has only a HTTP proxy server
so that firewalled clients can "surf the web". In this case, your
server host will receive connections at port 80 containing Java RMI
requests embedded in HTTP requests. You can use a HTTP server with
the <code>java-rmi.cgi</code> program, or you can run the Java RMI
server directly on port 80. <em>Either way, the server cannot use
callback objects exported by the clients.</em>.</p>
<p>A more optimistic case is that the client can make direct
connections to the server but cannot receive incoming connections
from the server. In this case, callback objects are not normally
possible either.</p>
<p>The most conservative approach, assuming no help from the client
firewall administrators, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using callback objects</li>
<li>Run your servers on `public' ports such as 80, 81, 8001, or
443</li>
<li>If the servers are not running on port 80, either:
<ul>
<li>Put a CGI-capable HTTP server on port 80 using the
<code>java-rmi.cgi</code> script; or</li>
<li>Run a port redirector (such as <code>DeleGate</code>) on port
80, which will accept connections and immediately connect to the
real server port to pass bytes back and forth. This will cause
<code>getClientHost()</code> to return misleading information, so
don't make the Registry available through this method unless it's
on a different host.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="servlet" id="servlet">C.13 Is it possible to replace
the <code>java-rmi.cgi</code> script that comes with the JDK
distribution with a servlet?</a></h3>
We've provided an <i><a href=
"archives/rmiservlethandler.zip">example</a></i> that demonstrates
how to implement the <code>java-rmi.cgi</code> script using a
servlet. The example also explains how to run a remote object
inside a servlet VM.
<p>Note: If you do not understand the role that
<code>java-rmi.cgi</code> plays in tunnelling remote method calls
over HTTP, please see the FAQ question regarding <a href=
"#firewallOut">HTTP tunnelling</a> in Java RMI.</p>
<h3><a name="notify" id="notify">D.1 Is there a way to get
automatic notification as soon as a remote VM fails?</a></h3>
Not at this time.
<h3><a name="newvm" id="newvm">D.2 From within a virtual machine,
can a new virtual machine be spawned on a remote machine?</a></h3>
The JDK includes object activation, and there are <i><a href=
"activation/overview.html">several tutorials</a></i> explaining how
to use it.
<h3><a name="unref" id="unref">D.3 Is it possible for a remote
object to be notified when all clients disconnect?</a></h3>
Yes. Your remote object will need to implement the <a href=
"../../../api/java/rmi/server/Unreferenced.html"><code>java.rmi.server.Unreferenced</code></a>
interface (in addition to any other necessary interfaces). Java RMI
will provide the notification by calling the
<code>unreferenced</code> method when all clients disconnect. Your
implementation of the <code>unreferenced</code> method will
determine what action your remote object should take upon receiving
such a notification. However, if there is a reference in the
registry, then the <code>Unreferenced.unreferenced</code> method
will never be called.
<h3><a name="noexit" id="noexit">D.4 Why doesn't my server program
exit when all clients disconnect?</a></h3>
In Java RMI, a server VM should exit if there are
<ul>
<li>No outstanding client-held references to the remote objects in
VM, and</li>
<li>No non-daemon threads executing in the VM.</li>
</ul>
However, just because there are no local or remote references to a
remote object does not mean the object will be garbage collected in
a timely fashion. It does mean that the remote object's memory can
be collected to satisfy a memory allocation that would otherwise
fail (with an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>).
<p>Although the Java API does not specify the timeliness of
collection anyway, there is a particular reason for the what can
seem like indefinitely delayed collection of remote objects. Under the covers, the Java RMI runtime
holds a weak reference to exported remote objects in a table (to
keep track of local as well as remote references to the object).
The only weak reference mechanism available in the JDK VM uses
a non-aggressive, caching collection policy (well-suited for a
browser), so objects that are only "weakly reachable" will not get
collected until the local GC decides that it really needs that
memory to satisfy another allocation. For an idle server, this
could never happen. But if memory is needed, an unreferenced server
object will be collected.</p>
<p>The Java SE platform includes a new infrastructure that Java RMI
will use to reduce significantly the number of conditions under
which this problem occurs.</p>
<h3><a name="leases" id="leases">D.5 How does the distributed
garbage collector detect a client that disconnects? Is it advisable
to use <code>System.exit</code> for graceful client
termination?</a></h3>
When the Java RMI runtime in a client VM detects that a remote
object is no longer referenced locally, it asynchronously notifies
the server relatively quickly so that the server can update the
object's referenced set accordingly. The distributed garbage
collector uses a lease associated with each client-held remote
object reference, and renews leases to remote objects while the
client still holds such references. The purpose of the lease
renewal mechanism is to allow the server to detect the
<i>abnormal</i> termination of clients, so that a server does not
hold on to a remote object forever because of a client that was not
able to send the appropriate "unreferenced" message before it
stopped running. In this context, a client invoking
<code>System.exit()</code> is considered abnormal termination,
because it does not allow the RMI runtime to send the appropriate
"unreferenced" messages to the server. Executing
<code>System.runFinalizersOnExit</code> in the client before
termination is not sufficient, because not all of the necessary
processing is handled in a finalizer; i.e. the "unreferenced"
message will not get sent to the server. (Using
"runFinalizersOnExit" is generally ill-advised and deadlock-prone
anyway.)
<p>If you need to use <code>System.exit()</code> to terminate a
client VM, to ensure that remote references held in that VM are
cleaned up in a more timely fashion, you should make sure that
there are no remote references still reachable. Explicitly null any
local references to make them unreachable from running threads. It
also may help to run a full garbage collection and to run
finalizers before exiting:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    System.gc();
    System.runFinalization();
</pre>
<h3><a name="leases2" id="leases2">D.6 How can my server tell when
a client crashes?</a></h3>
If you wait for the client's lease to run out, and the
<code>unreferenced()</code> method will then be called by the Java
RMI implementation (remember that the registry is also a client for
this purpose, since it holds references for all its bindings).
<p>If a client is holding a remote reference, it also holds a lease
for that reference, which must be renewed (by contacting the server
and making a <code>dirty()</code> call). When the final lease for
an exported object has expired or closed, the object is considered
unreferenced, and (if it implements
<code>java.rmi.Unreferenced</code>) its <code>unreferenced()</code>
method will be invoked.</p>
<p>If two or more clients have references to the same remote
object, the <code>unreferenced()</code> method will not be called
until all of them have expired their leases on it. Consequently, if
you are using this technique to track individual clients, each
client must have a reference to its own <code>Unreferenced</code>
object.</p>
<h3><a name="fastleases" id="fastleases">D.7 The
<code>unreferenced()</code> method doesn't get called until ten
minutes after I have stopped using the remote object! How can I
shorten this delay?</a></h3>
The lease expiration time is specified by the server, where it can
be set using a system property,
<code>java.rmi.dgc.leaseValue</code>, whose value is in
milliseconds. To set this to a shorter time (for example: 30
seconds), start the server like this:
<pre class="codeblock">
    java -Djava.rmi.dgc.leaseValue=30000 ServerMain
</pre>
<p>The default value is 600000 milliseconds (or 10 minutes).</p>
<p>The client will renew each lease when it is halfway expired. If
the lease interval is too short, the client will waste a lot of
network bandwidth needlessly renewing its lease. If the lease
interval is much too short, the client will be unable to renew the
lease in time, and the exported object may be deleted as a
result.</p>
<p>Future releases of Java RMI may invalidate remote references if
they fail to renew their leases (in order to preserve referential
integrity); you should not rely on being able to use stale
references to remote objects.</p>
<p>Note that you'll only have to wait for the timeout if the client
machine crashes. If the client has some control when the disconnect
occurs, it can send out the DGC clean call quickly, making the use
of <code>Unreferenced</code> quite timely. You can help this
process along by nulling out any references the client may have to
the remote object and then calling <code>System.gc()</code>.</p>
<h3><a name="crashnotif" id="crashnotif">D.8 Why can't I get an
immediate notification when a client crashes?</a></h3>
Because nothing the server does can distinguish a crashed host from
a network delay.
<p>If or when the crashed client later restarts and contacts the
server, the server can infer that the client has lost its state. If
a TCP connection is held open between the client and the server
throughout their interaction, then the server can detect the client
reboot when a later attempt to write to the connection fails
(including the hourly TCP keepalive packet, if enabled). However,
Java RMI is designed not to require such permanent connections, as
it impairs scalability and doesn't help very much.</p>
<p>Given that it is absolutely impossible to instantly determine
when a network peer crashes or becomes otherwise unavailable, you
must decide how your application should behave when a peer stops
responding.</p>
<p>The major tools you have for this task are timeouts and resets.
After a timeout, you may conclude that a peer is unreachable, but
the peer must be aware of the timeout so that it gives up trying to
reach you. The leasing mechanism is designed to do this
semi-automatically.</p>
<p>A reset is a purge of existing state held for a peer. For
example, a client may cause a reset when it first registers with
its server, causing the server to discard any previous state held
for that client (having deduced that the client has restarted
without memory of the previous, dead, session).</p>
<p>Frequently, the aim is to have and maintain a definitive list of
clients at the server, and to keep it up-to-date without error or
failure. Since failure and delay can happen at any time in a
networked system, some degree of error in the list must be
anticipated. If a lease or other mechanism is used to enforce a
timeout, then the problem of resource leakage is solved. If the
problem of stale data is more serious -- that is, if it would
interfere with correct operation -- then it must be explicitly
purged in cases where it would otherwise have an effect.</p>
<p>For example, if a business object is locked for editing by a
human, and the session dies, then the lock must be broken somehow.
In this case, the lock would need a timeout, but if the same human
logs in immediately and expects not to have to wait for the timeout
to expire, the new session must either take over the lock or assert
that the user holds no locks (allowing the server to safely kill
the lock).</p>
<h3><a name="rmicbatch" id="rmicbatch">D.9 How do I run the
<code>rmic</code> command in a DOS batch file?</a></h3>
In a DOS batch file, you have to insert the command
<code>call</code> before the executable in order for control to
return to the batch file. For example:
<pre class="codeblock">
    call rmic ClientHandler
    call rmic Server
    call rmic ServerHandler
    call rmic Client
</pre>
<h3><a name="getclient" id="getclient">D.10 In a remote object
implementation, how can I find the host name of the caller of a
remote method?</a></h3>
The <code>java.rmi.server.RemoteServer.getClientHost</code> method
returns the client host for the current invocation on the current
thread.
<h3><a name="inout" id="inout">D.11 Does Java RMI handle "out" and
"inout" parameters (like CORBA)?</a></h3>
Java RMI does not support "out" or "inout" parameters, just like
the rest of the core Java programming language. All remote calls
are methods of a remote object. Local objects are passed by copy
and remote objects are passed by reference to a stub. For more
details, see <i><a href=
"../../../platform/rmi/spec/rmi-objmodel7.html">Parameter Passing
in Remote Method Invocation</a></i> in the Java RMI Specification.
<h3><a name="caststub" id="caststub">D.12 Normally in the Java
programming language, it is possible to cast an interface instance
to an instance of the class from which it was created and use the
result. Why doesn't this work in Java RMI?</a></h3>
In Java RMI the client sees only a stub for the original object.
The stub implements only the remote interfaces and their remote
methods and cannot be cast back to the original implementation
class because it's just a stub.
<p>So, you cannot pass a remote object reference from a server to a
client, and then send it back to the server and be able to cast it
back to the original implementation class. You can, though, use the
remote object reference on the server to make a remote call to the
object.</p>
<p>If you need to find the implementation class again, you'll need
to keep a table that maps the remote reference to the
implementation class.</p>
<h3><a name="browsersupport" id="browsersupport">E.1 What if my
browser does not support the JDK or Java SE version I
need?</a></h3>
Try using the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/plugin-137649.html">Java
Plug-in</a> for browsers that do not support the JDK or Java SE
version you need.
<h3><a name="observer" id="observer">E.2 Can I implement remote
observer/observable objects in Java RMI?</a></h3>
What you can do is "wrap" <code>java.util.Observable</code> and
<code>java.util.Observer</code> with new interfaces (you could call
them <code>RemoteObservable</code> and
<code>RemoteObserver</code>). In these new interfaces, make each of
the methods throw <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code>. Then, your
remote objects can implement these interfaces.
<p>Note that since the "wrapped" non-remote object does not extend
<code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>, you will need to
explicitly export the object using the <code>exportObject</code>
method of <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code>. In doing this though,
you lose the <code>java.rmi.server.RemoteObject</code>
implementations of the <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code>,
and <code>toString</code> methods.</p>
<h3><a name="connection" id="connection">F.1 At what point is there
a "live" connection between the client and the server and how are
connections managed?</a></h3>
When a client does a "lookup" operation, a connection is made to
the <code>rmiregistry</code> on the specified host. In general, a
new connection may or may not be created for a remote call.
Connections are cached by the Java RMI transport for future use, so
if a connection is free to the right destination for a remote call,
then it is used. A client cannot explicitly close a connection to a
server, since connections are managed at the Java RMI transport
level. Connections will time out if they are unused for a period of
time.
<h3><a name="replace" id="replace">F.2 Does the Java platform
replace all remote objects with their stubs during a remote method
invocation?</a></h3>
The JRMP and Java RMI-IIOP implementations will replace each remote
object with a corresponding stub (of the same protocol), even deep
inside graphs of serializable objects.
<h3><a name="nosockets" id="nosockets">F.3 Is it possible to write
a new transport layer for Java RMI which does not use sockets? As a
follow-up question, how about a transport layer that uses
non-TCP-based sockets?</a></h3>
We have designed the transport interfaces so that different
implementations of these interfaces can be used by Java RMI. In
earlier releases, this abstraction was used for our purposes and
was not exposed for general use. Now, in the JDK, Java RMI supports
<i><a href="socketfactory/index.html">client and server socket
factories</a></i> that can be used to make Java RMI calls over
non-TCP-based sockets.
<h3><a name="polling" id="polling">F.4 I notice the registry
continues to use CPU resources, as if it were polling rather than
blocking on a <code>select()</code> call. Is the registry
implemented by polling?</a></h3>
Java RMI does not poll on select calls. There is a thread that
wakes up every so often and polls the table of exported remote
objects. This "reap" thread is used for the purposes of the
distributed garbage collector.
<h3><a name="numsockets" id="numsockets">F.5 Is there only one
socket connection between a client process and the server, no
matter how many stubs exist in that client process?</a></h3>
Java RMI reuses the socket connections between client and server
whenever possible. The current implementation creates additional
sockets on demand when they are needed. For example, if the
existing socket is in use by a call then a new socket is created
for the new call. Typically, there are at least two sockets open
since the distributed garbage collector needs to make remote calls
when remote objects are returned from the server. If a cached
connection remains unused for a period of time, the connection is
closed.
<h3><a name="license" id="license">G.1 What are the licensing
issues surrounding the use of Java RMI?</a></h3>
Java RMI is part of the Java SE platform and as such is subject to
the licensing terms of Java SE.

this incoming remote call as the program appears to be blocked on
standard input. What's the problem?</a></h3>
This is a known problem, not with Java RMI, but with the thread
that reads standard input. The thread does not yield on the
blocking read, but instead stays running, hardly letting the
listener get any cycles. We have tried two workarounds that seem
successful: set the main thread (the one reading standard input) to
a lower priority, or yield while bytes are not available in the
stream before actually reading it.
<h3><a name="passbycopy" id="passbycopy">G.3 I am copying array
elements to my remote server and changing the values, but the
incremented values are not copied back to the client. Why?</a></h3>
Non-remote objects are passed by copy, so if you want to have the
new values of the array reflected in the client, you will have to
send them back as a return argument.
<h3><a name="staticinit" id="staticinit">G.4 Am I allowed to have
static fields in a remote interface?</a></h3>
Yes. An initializer is run in each VM that loads the remote
interface, creating a new static variable with the specified
values. So, you have a <em>separate</em> copy of this static
variable in each VM that loads the remote interface.
<h3><a name="registry" id="registry">G.5 I locate the registry, but
then it seems that it's not there, what's happening?</a></h3>
The method <code>LocateRegistry.getRegistry(String host)</code>
does not contact the registry on the host, but rather just looks up
the host to make sure it exists. So, even though this method
succeeded, this does not necessarily mean that a registry is
running on the specified host. It just returns a stub that can then
access the registry.

<h2>Object Serialization</h2>
<h3>1. <a name="whyserial" id="whyserial"></a><b>Why must classes
implement <code>Serializable</code> in order to be written to an
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code>?</b></h3>
The decision to require that classes implement the
<code>java.io.Serializable</code> interface was not made lightly.
The design called for a balance between the needs of developers and
the needs of the system to be able to provide a predictable and
safe mechanism. The most difficult design constraint to satisfy was
the safety and security of classes for the Java programming
language.
<p>If classes were to be marked as being serializable the design
team worried that a developer, either out of forgetfulness,
laziness, or ignorance might not declare a class as being
<code>Serializable</code> and then make that class useless for RMI
or for purposes of persistence. We worried that the requirement
would place on a developer the burden of knowing how a class was to
be used by others in the future, an essentially unknowable
condition. Indeed, our preliminary design, as reflected in the
alpha API, concluded that the default case for a class ought to be
that the objects in the class be serializable. We changed our
design only after considerations of security and correctness
convinced us that the default had to be that an object not be
serialized.</p>
<h4>Security restrictions</h4>
The first consideration that caused us to change the default
behavior of objects had to do with security, and in particular in
the privacy of fields declared to be private, package protected, or
protected. The Java platform restricts access to such fields for
either read or write to a subset of the objects within the runtime.
<p>No such restriction can be made on an object once it has been
serialized; the stream of bytes that is the result of object
serialization can be read and altered by any object that has access
to that stream. This allows any object access to the state of a
serialized object, which can violate the privacy guarantees users
of the language expect. Further, the bytes in the stream can be
altered in arbitrary ways, allowing the reconstruction of an object
that was never created within the protections of a Java platform.
There are cases in which the re-creation of such an object could
compromise not only the privacy guarantees expected by users of the
Java platform, but the integrity of the platform itself.</p>
<p>These violations cannot be guarded against, since the whole idea
of serialization is to allow an object to be converted into a form
that can be moved outside of the Java platform (and therefore
outside of the privacy and integrity guarantees of that
environment) and then be brought back into the environment.
Requiring objects to be declared serializable does mean that the
class designer must make an active decision to allow the
possibility of such a breach in privacy or integrity. A developer
who does not know about serialization should not be open to
compromise because of this lack of knowledge. In addition, we would
hope that the developer who declares a class to be serializable
does so after some thought about the possible consequences of that
declaration.</p>
<p>Note that this sort of security problem is not one that can be
dealt with by the mechanism of a security manager. Since
serialization is intended to allow the transport of an object from
one virtual machine to some other (either over space, as it is used
in RMI, or over time, as when the stream is saved to a file), the
mechanisms used for security need to be independent of the runtime
environment of any particular virtual machine. We wanted to avoid
as much as possible the problem of being able to serialize an
object in one virtual machine and not being able to deserialize
that object in some other virtual machine. Since the security
manager is part of the runtime environment, using the security
manager for serialization would have violated this requirement.</p>
<h4>Forcing a conscious decision</h4>
While security concerns were the first reason for considering the
design change, a reason that we feel is at least as convincing is
that serialization should only be added to a class after some
design consideration. It is far too easy to design a class that
falls apart under serialization and re-construction. By requiring a
class designer to declare support for the serialization interface,
we hoped that the designer would also give some thought to the
process of serializing that class.
<p>Examples are easy to cite. Many classes deal with information
that only makes sense in the context of the runtime in which the
particular object exists; examples of such information include file
handles, open socket connections, security information, etc. Such
data can be dealt with easily by simply declaring the fields as
<code>transient</code>, but such a declaration is only necessary if
the object is going to be serialized. A novice (or forgetful, or
hurried) programmer might neglect to mark fields as
<code>transient</code> in much the same way he or she might neglect
to mark the class as implementing the <code>Serializable</code>
interface. Such a case should not lead to incorrect behavior; the
way to avoid this is to not serialize objects not marked as
implementing <code>Serializable</code>.</p>
<p>Another example of this sort is the "simple" object that is the
root of a graph that spans a large number of objects. Serializing
such an object could result in serializing lots of others, since
serialization works over an entire graph. Doing something like this
should be a conscious decision, not one that happens by
default.</p>
<p>The need for this sort of thought was brought home to us in the
group when we were going through the base Java API class libraries,
marking the system classes as serializable (where appropriate). We
had originally thought that this would be a fairly simple process,
and that most of the system classes could just be marked as
implementing <code>Serializable</code> and then use the default
implementation with no other changes. What we found was that this
was far less often the case than we had suspected. In a large
number of the classes, careful thought had to be given to whether
or not a field should be marked as <code>transient</code> or
whether it made sense to serialize the class at all.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no way to guarantee that a programmer or
class designer is actually going to think about these issues when
marking a class as serializable. However, by requiring the class to
declare itself as implementing the <code>Serializable</code>
interface we do require that some thought be given by the
programmer. Having serialization be the default state of an object
would mean that lack of thought could cause bad effects in a
program, something that the overall design of the Java platform has
attempted to avoid.</p>
<h3>2. <a name="whichserial" id="whichserial"></a><b>Which JDK 
system classes are marked serializable?</b></h3>
<i>Removed. This information is readily available from the API
documentation generated by the <code>javadoc</code> tool.</i>
<h3>3. <a name="awt" id="awt"></a><b>I am having problems
deserializing JDK AWT components. How can I make this
work?</b></h3>
When you serialize AWT widgets, also serialized are the Peer
objects that map the AWT functions to the local window system. When
you deserialize (reconstitute) the AWT widgets, the old Peers are
re-created, but they are out of date. Peers are native to the local
window system and contain pointers to data structures in the local
address space, and therefore cannot be moved.
<p>As a work around, you should first remove the top-level widget
from its container (so the widgets are no longer "live"). The peers
are discarded at this point and you will save only the AWT widget
state. When you later deserialize and read the widgets back in, add
the top level widget to the frame to make the AWT widgets appear.
You may need to add a <code>show</code> call.</p>
<p>AWT widgets are serializable. The
<code>java.awt.Component</code> class implements
<code>Serializable</code>.</p>
<h3>4. <a name="encryption" id="encryption"></a><b>Does object
serialization support encryption?</b></h3>
Object serialization does not contain any encryption/decryption in
itself. It writes to and reads from standard streams in the Java
API, so it can be coupled with any available encryption technology.
Object serialization can be used in many different ways. Other than
just writing and reading to and from files, it can also be used for
Java RMI to communicate between hosts.
<p>RMI's use of serialization leaves encryption and decryption to
the lower network transport. We expect that when a secure channel
is needed the network connections will be made using SSL or the
like (see <i><a href="socketfactory/SSLInfo.html">Using RMI with
SSL</a></i>).</p>
<h3>5. <a name="random" id="random"></a><b>The object serialization
classes are stream oriented. How do I write objects to a
random-access file?</b></h3>
Currently there is no direct way to write objects to a
random-access file.
<p>You can use <code>ByteArrayInputStream</code> and
<code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code> objects as intermediate places
to write and read bytes to and from the random access file and
create <code>ObjectInputStream</code>s and
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code>s from the byte streams to transport
the objects. You just have to make sure that you have the entire
object in the byte stream or reading/writing the object will
fail.</p>
<p>For example, <code>java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream</code> can be
used to receive the bytes of <code>ObjectOutputStream</code>. From
it you can get a result in the form of a byte array. That in turn
can be used with <code>ByteArrayInputStream</code> as input to an
<code>ObjectInput</code> stream.</p>
<h3>6. <a name="local" id="local"></a><b>When a local object is
serialized and passed as a parameter in a Java RMI call, are the
bytecodes for the local object's methods also passed? What about
object coherency, if the remote VM application "keeps" the object
handle?</b></h3>
The bytecodes for a local object's methods are not passed directly
in the <code>ObjectOutputStream</code>, but the object's class may
need to be loaded by the receiver if the class is not already
available locally. The class files themselves are not serialized,
just the names of the classes. All classes must be able to be
loaded during deserialization using the normal class loading
mechanisms. For applets, this means they are loaded by the
<code>AppletClassLoader</code>.
<p>There are no coherency guarantees for local objects passed to a
remote VM since such objects are passed by copying their contents
(a true pass-by-value).</p>
<h3>7. <a name="nofile" id="nofile"></a><b>How can I create an
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> from an
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code> without a file in between?</b></h3>
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code> and <code>ObjectInputStream</code>
work to/from any stream object. You could use a
<code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code> and then get the array and
insert it into a <code>ByteArrayInputStream</code>. You could also
use the piped stream classes as well. Any <code>java.io</code>
class that extends the <code>OutputStream</code> and
<code>InputStream</code> classes can be used.
<h3>8. <a name="handle" id="handle"></a><b>I create an object and
then send it across the net using the <code>writeObject</code>
method and receive it using the <code>readObject</code> method. If
I then change the value of a field in the object and send it as
before, the object that the <code>readObject</code> method returns
appears to be the same as the first object and does not reflect the
new value of the field. Should I be experiencing this
behavior?</b></h3>
The <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> class keeps track of each
object it serializes and sends only the handle if that object is
seen again. This is the way it deals with graphs of objects. The
corresponding <code>ObjectInputStream</code> keeps track of all of
the objects it has created and their handles so when the handle is
seen again it can return the same object. Both output and input
streams keep this state until they are freed.
<p>Alternatively, the <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> class
implements a <code>reset</code> method that discards the memory of
having sent an object, so sending an object again will make a
copy.</p>
<h3>9. <a name="serialthread" id="serialthread"></a><b>Are there
any plans to support the serialization of thread objects?</b></h3>
Threads will NOT be serializable. In the present implementation, if
you attempt to serialize and then deserialize a thread, there is NO
explicit allocation of a new native thread or stack; all that
happens is that the object is allocated system resources with none
of the native implementation. In short, it just won't work and will
fail in unpredictable ways.
<p>The difficulty with threads is that they have so much state
which is intricately tied into the virtual machine that it is
difficult or impossible to re-establish the context somewhere else.
For example, saving the VM call stack is insufficient because if
there were native methods that had called C procedures that in turn
called code for the Java platform, there would be an incredible mix
of Java programming language constructs and C pointers to deal
with. Also, serializing the stack would imply serializing any
object reachable from any stack variable.</p>
<p>If a thread were resumed in the same VM, it would be sharing a
lot of state with the original thread, and would therefore fail in
unpredictable ways if both threads were running at once, just like
two C threads trying to share a stack. When deserialized in a
separate VM, it's hard to tell what might happen.</p>
<h3>10. <a name="diff" id="diff"></a><b>Can I compute
diff(serial(x),serial(y))?</b></h3>
The diff will produce the same stream each time the same object is
serialized. You will need to create a new
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code> to serialize each object.
<h3>11. <a name="zip" id="zip"></a><b>Can I compress the serial
representation of my objects using my own zip and unzip
methods?</b></h3>
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code> produces an
<code>OutputStream</code>; if your zip object extends the
<code>OutputStream</code> class there is no problem compressing it.
<h3>12. <a name="compress" id="compress"></a><b>Can I execute
methods on compressed versions of my objects, for example
isempty(zip(serial(x)))?</b></h3>
This is not really viable for arbitrary objects because of the
encoding of objects. For a particular object (such as a String) you
can compare the resulting bit streams. The encoding is stable, in
that every time the same object is encoded it is encoded to the
same set of bits.
<h3>13. <a name="font" id="font"></a><b>If I try to serialize a
font or image object and then try to reconstitute it in a different
VM, my application dies. Why?</b></h3>
<i>Removed. Fonts are now serializable, but images are not.</i>
<h3>14. <a name="tree" id="tree"></a><b>How do I serialize a tree
of objects?</b></h3>
<p>Here's a brief example that shows how to serialize a tree of
objects.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
import java.io.*;

class tree implements java.io.Serializable {
    public tree left;
    public tree right;
    public int id;
    public int level;

    private static int count = 0;

    public tree(int depth) {
        id = count++;
        level = depth;
        if (depth &gt; 0) {
            left = new tree(depth-1);
            right = new tree(depth-1);
        }
    }

    public void print(int levels) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; level; i++)
            System.out.print("  ");
        System.out.println("node " + id);

        if (level &lt;= levels &amp;&amp; left != null)
            left.print(levels);

        if (level &lt;= levels &amp;&amp; right != null)
            right.print(levels);
    }


    public static void main (String argv[]) {

        try {
            /* Create a file to write the serialized tree to. */
            FileOutputStream ostream = new FileOutputStream("tree.tmp");
            /* Create the output stream */
            ObjectOutputStream p = new ObjectOutputStream(ostream);

            /* Create a tree with three levels. */
            tree base = new tree(3);

            p.writeObject(base); // Write the tree to the stream.
            p.flush();
            ostream.close();    // close the file.
            
            /* Open the file and set to read objects from it. */
            FileInputStream istream = new FileInputStream("tree.tmp");
            ObjectInputStream q = new ObjectInputStream(istream);
            
            /* Read a tree object, and all the subtrees */
            tree new_tree = (tree)q.readObject();

            new_tree.print(3);  // Print out the top 3 levels of the tree
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<h3>15. <a name="serialsuper" id="serialsuper"></a><b>If class A
does not implement <code>Serializable</code> but a subclass B
implements <code>Serializable</code>, will the fields of class A be
serialized when B is serialized?</b></h3>
Only the fields of <code>Serializable</code> objects are written
out and restored. The object may be restored only if class A has a
no-arg constructor that will initialize the fields of
non-serializable supertypes. If the subclass has access to the
state of the superclass it can implement <code>writeObject</code>
and <code>readObject</code> to save and restore that state.
