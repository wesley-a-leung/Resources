<h1>Windows Look and Feel Update</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The ideal Swing application running under the Windows look and
feel would be indistinguishable from its native running
counterparts, however due to both changes in the native Windows
look and feel (Windows 98, Windows 2000, etc.) and atrophy of our
existing Windows look and feel implementation, this has not been
the reality. However, for this release we have provided an updated
Windows look and feel which integrates seamlessly into the Windows
desktop.</p>
<p>This project was composed of a set of independent smaller
projects, which involve either fixing a previous emulation
deficiency or adding functionality to track 2000/98 features. In
some cases the project spans both Swing and AWT:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#bugs">Fix Emulation Bugs</a></li>
<li><a href="#desktopprops">Desktop Property Support</a></li>
<li><a href="#lists">Column-Wrapping Lists</a></li>
<li><a href="#hottrack">Hot-tracking Toolbar Buttons</a></li>
<li><a href="#gradient">Gradient Titlebars</a></li>
<li><a href="#keyboard">Keyboard Navigation Hiding</a></li>
<li><a href="#wheel">Scroll Wheel Support</a></li>
<li><a href="#transition">Menu/Tooltip Transition Effects</a></li>
<li><a href="#filechooser">FileChooser Makeover</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We chose to modify and enhance the
<code>com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows</code> look and feel package
rather than introduce a new 'window2000' package. Almost all of the
new functionality is keyed off of Windows native user preferences
so that an updated windows look and feel package gracefully runs on
eitherWindows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT or Windows 2000 machines.
In other words, if a running Swing application detects that a
particular user preference (such as Menu fading) doesn't exist,
then the windows look and feel will not execute that feature.</p>
<p>The focus of this project was quality, not quantity. Where we
deemed it difficult to implement a feature with a high quality
result, we deferred that feature to a future release when we can
emulate it with better fidelity.</p>
<h3><a name="bugs" id="bugs">Fix Emulation Bugs</a></h3>
<p>There were many bugs filed against our Windows look and feel and
we fixed many of these with this release. We are tracking these
bugs witha &quot;w2k&quot; keyword. See <a href=
"w2k_bugs.html">Windows Look And Feel Buglist</a> for a list of
these windows look and feel bugs.</p>
<h3><a name="desktopprops" id="desktopprops">Desktop Property
Support</a></h3>
<p>The current Windows look and feel in Swing only tracks the
user's desktop colorscheme (via AWT's SystemColor mechanism).
However, on the Windowsdesktop, the user can set many more GUI
preferences, such as fonts, sounds, metrics, and can change them at
any time and have Windows programs dynamically reflect those
changes. We have revised Swing to honor a wider range of user
preferences and to also support responding to dynamic changes made
by the user. See <a href="w2k_props.html">Windows Desktop
Properties Support Specification</a> for details.</p>
<h3><a name="lists" id="lists">Column-Wrapping Lists</a></h3>
<p>List was only capable of displaying a single column and has been
updated to support wrapping into multiple columns (like the Windows
Explorer pane). This feature is also used to better support the
Windows filechooser. See <a href="SwingChanges.html#bug4308384">JList
Spec update</a> for details.</p>
<h3><a name="hottrack" id="hottrack">Hot-Tracking Toolbar
Buttons</a></h3>
<p>Buttons contained inside toolbars have become flat in appearance
and only when they are 'rolled over' do the borders appear. This
feature is supported by the Metal look and feel, but will be added
as a general Swing toolbar feature.</p>
<h3><a name="gradient" id="gradient">Gradient Titlebars</a></h3>
<p>The titlebars on toplevel windows in Windows 2000 by default use
a gradient pattern instead of a solid bar color. We get this for
free on toplevel windows such as <code>JFrame</code>, however we
will use Java2D to implement this rendering for
<code>JInternalFrame</code>.</p>
<h3><a name="wheel" id="wheel">Scroll Wheel Support</a></h3>
<p>Almost all PCs these days come with a scroll-wheel on the mouse
and to support this AWT is adding support for scroll wheel input
and Swing's scrolling components (<code>JScrollPane</code>,
<code>JScrollbar</code>) are being modified to handle this new
event type. See <a href="SwingChanges.html#mouseWheel">MouseWheel
API for details of AWT support</a> and see <a href=
"SwingChanges.html#bug4356268">JScrollPane changes</a> for details of
support in Swing.</p>
<h3><a name="keyboard" id="keyboard">Keyboard Navigation
Hiding</a></h3>
<p>In windows the user can set a desktop property which causes
applications to hide their keyboard navigation cues *until* ALT is
pressed, at which time they magically appear. If the user has this
option set on the desktop, Swing will implement this behavior in
its menus. See <a href="keyboard_nav_hiding.html">Keyboard
Navigation Spec</a> for more information.</p>
<h3><a name="transition" id="transition">Menu/Tooltip Transition
Effects</a></h3>
<p>The most obvious feature addition to the Windows look and feel
is the new stylistic menu animation. In Windows 98, menus can be
set to appear by sliding out. Windows 2000 then introduced a very
hip fade-in/fade-out for menus and tooltips.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the most accurate visual effect, this feature
is implemented by forcing menus/tooltips to be true toplevel
&quot;heavyweight&quot; windows which can take advantage of
Microsoft Windows native window animation functionality inside the
AWT.</p>
<h3><a name="filechooser" id="filechooser">File Chooser
Makeover</a></h3>
<p>Although Swing's <code>JFileChooser</code> component closely
resembles the Windows file chooser, there are some deficiencies
which limit its use on the Windows platform, such as the lack of
support for network browsing and the Windows virtual
desktop(&quot;My Computer&quot;, &quot;My Network&quot;, etc.). See
<a href="SwingChanges.html#JFileChooser">JFileChooser Spec
update</a> for more information.</p>
