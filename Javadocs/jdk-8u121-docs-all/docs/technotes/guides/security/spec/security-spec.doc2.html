<h2><a name="a19853" id="a19853"><i>2</i> New Protection Mechanisms
-- Overview of Basic Concepts</a></h2>
<a name="a19854" id="a19854"><!-- --></a> We now go over, in some
detail, the new protection architecture and give a brief
explanation of its functionality. We start with an overview of the
basic concepts behind the new architecture. We then introduce the
major new classes in a natural order, starting with permission
specifications, going on to the policy and related features,
followed by access control and its usage, and then covering secure
class loading and resolution.
<p><a name="a16572" id="a16572"><!-- --></a> A fundamental concept
and important building block of system security is the protection
domain [Saltzer and Schroeder 75]. A domain can be scoped by the
set of objects that are currently directly accessible by a
principal, where a principal is an entity in the computer system to
which permissions (and as a result, accountability) are granted.
The sandbox utilized in JDK 1.0 is one example of a protection
domain with a fixed boundary.</p>
<p><a name="a16596" id="a16596"><!-- --></a> The protection domain
concept serves as a convenient mechanism for grouping and isolation
between units of protection. For example, it is possible (but not
yet provided as a built-in feature) to separate protection domains
from interacting with each other so that any permitted interaction
must be either through trusted system code or explicitly allowed by
the domains concerned. Note that existing object accessibility
rules remain valid under the new security architecture.</p>
<p><a name="a16647" id="a16647"><!-- --></a> Protection domains
generally fall into two distinct categories: system domain and
application domain. It is important that all protected external
resources, such as the file system, the networking facility, and
the screen and keyboard, be accessible only via system domains. The
figure below illustrates the domain composition of a Java
application environment.</p>
<p><a name="a17945" id="a17945"><!-- --></a></p>
<img alt="See long description" longdesc=
"security-spec2.txt" src="security-spec.doc.anc2.gif" />
<a href="security-spec2.txt" title="Long description for">[D]</a>
<p><a name="a29031" id="a29031"><!-- --></a> A domain conceptually
encloses a set of classes whose instances are granted the same set
of permissions. Protection domains are determined by the policy
currently in effect. The Java application environment maintains a
mapping from code (classes and instances) to their protection
domains and then to their permissions, as illustrated by the figure
below.</p>
<p><a name="a21570" id="a21570"><!-- --></a></p>
<img alt="See long description" longdesc=
"security-spec3.txt" src="security-spec.doc.anc.gif" />
<a href="security-spec3.txt" title="Long description for">[D]</a>
<p><a name="a21576" id="a21576"><!-- --></a></p>
<p><a name="a19728" id="a19728"><!-- --></a> A thread of execution
(which is often, but not necessarily tied to, a single Java thread,
which in turn is not necessarily tied to the thread concept of the
underlying operation system) may occur completely within a single
protection domain or may involve an application domain and also the
system domain. For example, an application that prints a message
out will have to interact with the system domain that is the only
access point to an output stream. In this case, it is crucial that
at any time the application domain does not gain additional
permissions by calling the system domain. Otherwise, there can be
serious security implications.</p>
<p><a name="a16749" id="a16749"><!-- --></a> In the reverse
situation where a system domain invokes a method from an
application domain, such as when the AWT system domain calls an
applet&#39;s paint method to display the applet, it is again
crucial that at any time the effective access rights are the same
as current rights enabled in the application domain.</p>
<p><a name="a18333" id="a18333"><!-- --></a> In other words, a less
&#34;powerful&#34; domain cannot gain additional permissions as a
result of calling or being called by a more powerful domain.</p>
<p><a name="a16769" id="a16769"><!-- --></a> This discussion of one
thread involving two protection domains naturally generalizes to a
thread that traverses multiple protection domains. A simple and
prudent rule of thumb for calculating permissions is the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="a16797" id="a16797"><!-- --></a> The permission set of
an execution thread is considered to be the intersection of the
permissions of all protection domains traversed by the execution
thread.</li>
<li><a name="a29045" id="a29045"><!-- --></a> When a piece of code
calls the <code>doPrivileged</code> method (see below), the
permission set of the execution thread is considered to include a
permission if it is allowed by the said code&#39;s protection
domain and by all protection domains that are called or entered
directly or indirectly subsequently.</li>
</ul>
<a name="a25333" id="a25333"><!-- --></a> As you can see, the
<code>doPrivileged</code> method enables a piece of trusted code to
temporarily enable access to more resources than are available
directly to the application that called it. This is necessary in
some situations. For example, an application may not be allowed
direct access to files that contain fonts, but the system utility
to display a document must obtain those fonts, on behalf of the
user. We provide the <code>doPrivileged</code> method for the
system domain to deal with this situation, and the method is in
fact available to all domains.
<p><a name="a16813" id="a16813"><!-- --></a> During execution, when
access to a critical system resource (such as file I/O and network
I/O) is requested, the resource-handling code directly or
indirectly invokes a special AccessController class method that
evaluates the request and decides if the request should be granted
or denied.</p>
<p><a name="a16856" id="a16856"><!-- --></a> Such an evaluation
follows and generalizes the &#34;rule of thumb&#34; given above.
The actual way in which the evaluation is conducted can vary
between implementations. The basic principle is to examine the call
history and the permissions granted to the relevant protection
domains, and to return silently if the request is granted or throw
a security exception if the request is denied.</p>
<p><a name="a18324" id="a18324"><!-- --></a> Finally, each domain
(system or application) may also implement additional protection of
its internal resources within its own domain boundary. For example,
a banking application may need to support and protect internal
concepts such as checking accounts, deposits and withdrawals.
Because the semantics of such protection is unlikely to be
predictable or enforceable by the Java 2 SDK, the protection system
at this level is best left to the system or application developers.
Nevertheless, whenever appropriate, we provide helpful primitives
to simplify developers&#39; tasks. One such primitive is the
SignedObject class, whose detail we will describe later.</p>
