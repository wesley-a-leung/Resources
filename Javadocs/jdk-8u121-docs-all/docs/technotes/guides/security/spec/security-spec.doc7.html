<h2><a name="a28311" id="a28311"><i>7</i> GuardedObject and
SignedObject</a></h2>
<br />
<h3><a name="a28312" id="a28312"><!-- --></a> <i>7.1</i>
java.security.GuardedObject and java.security.Guard</h3>
<a name="a28313" id="a28313"><!-- --></a> Recall that the class
AccessControlContext is useful when an access control decision has
to be made in a different context. There is another such scenario,
where the supplier of a resource is not in the same thread as the
comsumer of that resource, and the consumer thread cannot provide
the supplier thread the access control context information (because
the context is security-sensitive, or the context is too large to
pass, or for other reasons). For this case, we provide a class
called GuardedObject to protect access to the resource, illustrated
in the figure below.
<p><a name="a28343" id="a28343"><!-- --></a></p>
<img src="security-spec.doc.ancA3.gif" alt=
"Illustration of previous context" />
<p><a name="a28344" id="a28344"><!-- --></a></p>
<p><a name="a28345" id="a28345"><!-- --></a> The basic idea is that
the supplier of the resource can create an object representing the
resource, create a GuardedObject that embeds the resource object
inside, and then provide the GuardedObject to the consumer. In
creating the GuardedObject, the supplier also specifies a Guard
object such that anyone (including the consumer) can only obtain
the resource object if certain (security) checks inside the Guard
are satisfied.</p>
<p><a name="a28346" id="a28346"><!-- --></a> Guard is an interface,
so any object can choose to become a Guard. The only method in this
interface is called <code>checkGuard</code>. It takes an Object
argument and it performs certain (security) checks. The Permission
class in java.security implements the Guard interface.</p>
<p><a name="a28347" id="a28347"><!-- --></a> For example, suppose a
system thread is asked to open a file /a/b/c.txt for read access,
but the system thread does not know who the requestor is or under
what circumstances the request is made. Therefore, the correct
access control decision cannot be made at the server side. The
system thread can use GuardedObject to delay the access control
checking, as follows.</p>
<pre>
FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("/a/b/c.txt");
FilePermission p = new FilePermission("/a/b/c.txt", "read");
GuardedObject g = new GuardedObject(f, p);
</pre>
<a name="a28349" id="a28349"><!-- --></a> Now the system thread can
pass g to the consumer thread. For that thread to obtain the file
input stream, it has to call
<pre>
FileInputStream fis = (FileInputStream) g.getObject();
</pre>
<a name="a28351" id="a28351"><!-- --></a> This method in turn
invokes the <code>checkGuard</code> method on the Guard object p,
and because p is a Permission, its <code>checkGuard</code> method
is in fact:
<pre>
SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
if (sm != null) sm.checkPermission(this);
</pre>
<a name="a28353" id="a28353"><!-- --></a> This ensures that a
proper access control check takes place within the consumer
context. In fact, one can replace often-used hash tables and access
control lists in many cases and simply store a hash table of
GuardedObjects.
<p><a name="a28354" id="a28354"><!-- --></a> This basic pattern of
GuardedObject and Guard is very general, and we expect that by
extending the basic Guard and GuardedObject classes, developers can
easily obtain quite powerful access control tools. For example,
per-method invocation can be achieved with an appropriate Guard for
each method, and a Guard can check the time of the day, the signer
or other identification of the caller, or any other relevant
information.</p>
<p><a name="a28355" id="a28355"><!-- --></a> Note that certain
typing information is lost because GuardedObject returns an Object.
GuardedObject is intended to be used between cooperating parties so
that the receiving party should know what type of object to expect
(and to cast for). In fact, we envision that most usage of
GuardedObject involves subclassing it (say to form a
GuardedFileInputStream class), thus encapsulating typing
information, and casting can happen suitably in the subclass.</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="a28356" id="a28356"><!-- --></a> <i>7.2</i>
java.security.SignedObject</h3>
<a name="a28357" id="a28357"><!-- --></a> This class is an
essential building block for other security primitives.
SignedObject contains another Serializable object, the
(to-be-)signed object and its signature. If the signature is not
null, it contains a valid digital signature of the signed object.
This is illustrated in the figure below.
<p><a name="a28372" id="a28372"><!-- --></a></p>
<img src="security-spec.doc.ancA9.gif" alt=
"The previous context describes this graphic" />
<p><a name="a28373" id="a28373"><!-- --></a></p>
<p><a name="a28374" id="a28374"><!-- --></a> The underlying signing
algorithm is set through a Signature object as a parameter to the
<code>sign</code> method call, and the algorithm can be, among
others, the NIST standard DSA, using DSA and SHA-1. The algorithm
is specified using the same convention for signatures, such as
&#34;SHA/DSA&#34;.</p>
<p><a name="a28375" id="a28375"><!-- --></a> The signed object is a
&#34;deep copy&#34; (in serialized form) of an original object.
Once the copy is made, further manipulation of the original object
has no side effect on the copy. A signed object is immutable.</p>
<p><a name="a28376" id="a28376"><!-- --></a> A typical example of
creating a signed object is the following:</p>
<pre>
Signature signingEngine =
    Signature.getInstance(algorithm,provider);
SignedObject so =
    new SignedObject(myobject, signingKey, signingEngine);
</pre>
<a name="a28378" id="a28378"><!-- --></a> A typical example of
verification is the following (having received SignedObject
<code>so</code>), where the first line is not needed if the name of
the algorithm is known:
<pre>
String algorithm = so.getAlgorithm();
Signature verificationEngine =
    Signature.getInstance(algorithm, provider);
so.verify(verificationEngine);
</pre>
<a name="a28380" id="a28380"><!-- --></a> Potential applications of
SignedObject include:
<ul>
<li><a name="a28381" id="a28381"><!-- --></a> It can be used
internally to any Java application environment as an unforgeable
authorization token -- one that can be passed around without the
fear that the token can be maliciously modified without being
detected.</li>
<li><a name="a28382" id="a28382"><!-- --></a> It can be used to
sign and serialize data/object for storage outside the Java runtime
(e.g., storing critical access control data on disk).</li>
<li><a name="a28383" id="a28383"><!-- --></a> Nested SignedObjects
can be used to construct a logical sequence of signatures,
resembling a chain of authorization and delegation.</li>
</ul>
<a name="a28384" id="a28384"><!-- --></a> It is intended that this
class can be subclassed in the future to allow multiple signatures
on the same signed object. In that case, existing method calls in
this base class will be fully compatible in semantics. In
particular, any <code>get</code> method will return the unique
value if there is only one signature, and will return an arbitrary
one from the set of signatures if there is more than one
signature.<br />
