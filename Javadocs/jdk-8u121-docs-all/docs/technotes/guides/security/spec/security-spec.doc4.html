and Algorithms</a></h2>
<br />
<h3><a name="a21491" id="a21491"><!-- --></a> <i>4.1</i>
java.security.ProtectionDomain</h3>
<a name="a24479" id="a24479"><!-- --></a> The ProtectionDomain
class encapsulates the characteristics of a domain. Such a domain
encloses a set of classes whose instances are granted a set of
permissions when being executed on behalf of a given set of
Principals.
<p>A ProtectionDomain is constructed with a CodeSource, a
ClassLoader, an array of Principals, and a collection of
Permissions. The CodeSource encapsulates the codebase
(java.net.URL) for all classes in this domain, as well as a set of
certificates (of type java.security.cert.Certificate) for public
keys that correspond to the private keys that signed all code in
this domain. The Principals represent the user on whose behalf the
code is running.</p>
<p><a name="a24517" id="a24517"><!-- --></a> The permissions passed
in at ProtectionDomain construction time represent a static set of
permissions bound to the domain regardless of the Policy in force.
The ProtectionDomain subsequently consults the current policy
during each security check to retrieve dynamic permissions granted
to the domain.</p>
<p><a name="a24485" id="a24485"><!-- --></a> Classes from different
CodeSources, or that are being executed on behalf of different
principals, belong to different domains.</p>
<p><a name="a27549" id="a27549"><!-- --></a> Today all code shipped
as part of the Java 2 SDK is considered system code and run inside
the unique system domain. Each applet or application runs in its
appropriate domain, determined by policy.</p>
<p><a name="a17021" id="a17021"><!-- --></a> It is possible to
ensure that objects in any non-system domain cannot automatically
discover objects in another non-system domain. This partition can
be achieved by careful class resolution and loading, for example,
using different classloaders for different domains. However,
SecureClassLoader (or its subclasses) can, at its choice, load
classes from different domains, thus allowing these classes to
co-exist within the same name space (as partitioned by a
classloader).</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="a17119" id="a17119"><!-- --></a> <i>4.2</i>
java.security.AccessController</h3>
<a name="a24542" id="a24542"><!-- --></a> The AccessController
class is used for three purposes, each of which is described in
further detail in sections below:
<ul>
<li><a name="a24544" id="a24544"><!-- --></a> to decide whether an
access to a critical system resource is to be allowed or denied,
based on the security policy currently in effect,</li>
<li><a name="a24545" id="a24545"><!-- --></a> to mark code as being
"privileged", thus affecting subsequent access determinations,
and</li>
<li><a name="a24546" id="a24546"><!-- --></a> to obtain a
"snapshot" of the current calling context so access-control
decisions from a different context can be made with respect to the
saved context.</li>
</ul>
<a name="a24568" id="a24568"><!-- --></a> Any code that controls
access to system resources should invoke AccessController methods
if it wishes to use the specific security model and access control
algorithm utilized by these methods. If, on the other hand, the
application wishes to defer the security model to that of the
SecurityManager installed at runtime, then it should instead invoke
corresponding methods in the SecurityManager class.
<p><a name="a18365" id="a18365"><!-- --></a> For example, the
typical way to invoke access control has been the following code
(taken from an earlier version of JDK):</p>
<pre>
 ClassLoader loader = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
        if (loader != null) {
                SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
            if (security != null) {
                security.checkRead("path/file");
            }
        }
</pre>
<a name="a17167" id="a17167"><!-- --></a> Under the new
architecture, the check typically should be invoked whether or not
there is a classloader associated with a calling class. It could be
simply, for example:
<pre>
FilePermission perm = new FilePermission("path/file", "read");
AccessController.checkPermission(perm);
</pre>
<a name="a24600" id="a24600"><!-- --></a> The AccessController
<code>checkPermission</code> method examines the current execution
context and makes the right decision as to whether or not the
requested access is allowed. If it is, this check returns quietly.
Otherwise, an AccessControlException (a subclass of
java.lang.SecurityException) is thrown.
<p><a name="a19481" id="a19481"><!-- --></a> Note that there are
(legacy) cases, for example, in some browsers, where whether there
is a SecurityManager installed signifies one or the other security
state that may result in different actions being taken. For
backward compatibility, the <code>checkPermission</code> method on
SecurityManager can be used.</p>
<pre>
SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
if (security != null) {
    FilePermission perm = new FilePermission("path/file", "read");
    security.checkPermission(perm);
}
</pre>
<a name="a22739" id="a22739"><!-- --></a> We currently do not
change this aspect of the SecurityManager usage, but would
encourage application developers to use new techniques introduced
in the Java 2 SDK in their future programming when the built-in
access control algorithm is appropriate.
<p><a name="a24648" id="a24648"><!-- --></a> The default behavior
of the SecurityManager <code>checkPermission</code> method is
actually to call the AccessController <code>checkPermission</code>
method. A different SecurityManager implementation may implement
its own security management approach, possibly including the
addition of further constraints used in determining whether or not
an access is permitted.</p>
<br />
<a name="a24646" id="a24646"><!-- --></a>
<h4><i>4.2.1 Algorithm for Checking Permissions</i></h4>
<a name="a20502" id="a20502"><!-- --></a> Suppose access control
checking occurs in a thread of computation that has a chain of
multiple callers (think of this as multiple method calls that cross
the protection domain boundaries), as illustrated in the next
figure.
<p><a name="a21585" id="a21585"><!-- --></a></p>
<img src="security-spec.doc.anc1.gif" alt=
"Illustration of access control" />
<p><a name="a20556" id="a20556"><!-- --></a> When the
<code>checkPermission</code> method of the AccessController is
invoked by the most recent caller (e.g., a method in the File
class), the basic algorithm for deciding whether to allow or deny
the requested access is as follows.</p>
<a name="a20557" id="a20557"><!-- --></a> If any caller in the call
chain does not have the requested permission,
AccessControlException is thrown, unless the following is true -- a
caller whose domain is granted the said permission has been marked
as &#34;privileged&#34; (see the next section) and all parties
subsequently called by this caller (directly or indirectly) all
have the said permission. <a name="a20546" id="a20546"><!-- --></a>
There are obviously two implementation strategies:
<ul>
<li><a name="a20547" id="a20547"><!-- --></a> In an &#34;eager
evaluation&#34; implementation, whenever a thread enters a new
protection domain or exits from one, the set of effective
permissions is updated dynamically.</li>
</ul>
<a name="a20548" id="a20548"><!-- --></a> The benefit is that
checking whether a permission is allowed is simplified and can be
faster in many cases. The disadvantage is that, because permission
checking occurs much less frequently than cross-domain calls, a
large percentage of permission updates are likely to be useless
effort.
<ul>
<li><a name="a20549" id="a20549"><!-- --></a> In a &#34;lazy
evaluation&#34; implementation, whenever permission checking is
requested, the thread state (as reflected by the current state,
including the current thread&#39;s call stack or its equivalent) is
examined and a decision is reached to either deny or grant the
particular access requested.</li>
</ul>
<a name="a20504" id="a20504"><!-- --></a> One potential downside of
this approach is performance penalty at permission checking time,
although this penalty would have been incurred anyway in the
&#34;eager evaluation&#34; approach (albeit at earlier times and
spread out among each cross-domain call). Our implementation so far
has yielded acceptable performance, so we feel that lazy evaluation
is the most economical approach overall.
<p><a name="a20537" id="a20537"><!-- --></a> Therefore, the
algorithm for checking permissions is currently implemented as
&#34;lazy evaluation&#34;. Suppose the current thread traversed m
callers, in the order of caller 1 to caller 2 to caller m. Then
caller m invoked the <code>checkPermission</code> method. The basic
algorithm <code>checkPermission</code> uses to determine whether
access is granted or denied is the following (see subsequent
sections for refinements):</p>
<pre>
 i = m;
 while (i &gt; 0) {
     if (caller i's domain does not have the permission)
         throw AccessControlException
     else if (caller i is marked as privileged) 
         return;
     i = i - 1;
 };
</pre>
<br />
<a name="a20573" id="a20573"><!-- --></a>
<h4><i>4.2.2 Handling Privileges</i></h4>
<a name="a20571" id="a20571"><!-- --></a> A new, static method in
the AccessController class allows code in a class instance to
inform the AccessController that a body of its code is
&#34;privileged&#34; in that it is solely responsible for
requesting access to its available resources, no matter what code
caused it to do so.
<p><a name="a24767" id="a24767"><!-- --></a> That is, a caller can
be marked as being "privileged" when it calls the
<code>doPrivileged</code> method. When making access control
decisions, the <code>checkPermission</code> method stops checking
if it reaches a caller that was marked as "privileged" via a
<code>doPrivileged</code> call without a context argument (see a
subsequent section for information about a context argument). If
that caller's domain has the specified permission, no further
checking is done and <code>checkPermission</code> returns quietly,
indicating that the requested access is allowed. If that domain
does not have the specified permission, an exception is thrown, as
usual.</p>
<p><a name="a27712" id="a27712"><!-- --></a> The normal use of the
"privileged" feature is as follows:</p>
<p><a name="a27774" id="a27774"><!-- --></a> If you don't need to
return a value from within the "privileged" block, do the
following:</p>
<pre>
  somemethod() {
       ...normal code here...
       AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() {
           public Object run() {
               // privileged code goes here, for example:
               System.loadLibrary("awt");
               return null; // nothing to return
           }
       });
       ...normal code here...
  }
</pre>
<a name="a27912" id="a27912"><!-- --></a> PrivilegedAction is an
interface with a single method, named <code>run</code>, that
returns an Object. The above example shows creation of an anonymous
inner class implementing that interface; a concrete implementation
of the <code>run</code> method is supplied. When the call to
<code>doPrivileged</code> is made, an instance of the
PrivilegedAction implementation is passed to it. The
<code>doPrivileged</code> method calls the <code>run</code> method
from the PrivilegedAction implementation after enabling privileges,
and returns the <code>run</code> method's return value as the
<code>doPrivileged</code> return value, which is ignored in this
example.
<p><a name="a28071" id="a28071"><!-- --></a> (For more information
about inner classes, see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html">Nested Classes</a> in the Java Tutorials.</p>
<p><a name="a28072" id="a28072"><!-- --></a> If you need to return
a value, you can do something like the following:</p>
<pre>
  somemethod() {
       ...normal code here...
       String user = (String) AccessController.doPrivileged(
         new PrivilegedAction() {
           public Object run() {
               return System.getProperty("user.name");
           }
         }
       );
       ...normal code here...
  }
</pre>
<a name="a27738" id="a27738"><!-- --></a> If the action performed
in your <code>run</code> method could throw a "checked" exception
(one listed in the <code>throws</code> clause of a method), then
you need to use the PrivilegedExceptionAction interface instead of
the PrivilegedAction interface:
<pre>
  somemethod() throws FileNotFoundException {
       ...normal code here...
     try {
       FileInputStream fis = (FileInputStream)
        AccessController.doPrivileged(
         new PrivilegedExceptionAction() {
           public Object run() throws FileNotFoundException {
               return new FileInputStream("someFile");
           }
         }
       );
     } catch (PrivilegedActionException e) {
       // e.getException() should be an instance of
       // FileNotFoundException,
       // as only "checked" exceptions will be "wrapped" in a
       // &lt;code&gt;PrivilegedActionException&lt;/code&gt;.
       throw (FileNotFoundException) e.getException();
     }
       ...normal code here...
 }
</pre>
<a name="a18471" id="a18471"><!-- --></a> Some important points
about being privileged: Firstly, this concept only exists within a
single thread. As soon as the privileged code completes, the
privilege is guaranteed to be erased or revoked.
<p><a name="a24808" id="a24808"><!-- --></a> Secondly, in this
example, the body of code in the <code>run</code> method is
privileged. However, if it calls less trustworthy code that is less
privileged, that code will not gain any privileges as a result; a
permission is only granted if the privileged code has the
permission <em>and</em> so do all the subsequent callers in the
call chain up to the <code>checkPermission</code> call.</p>
<p><a name="a29313" id="a29313"><!-- --></a> For more information
about marking code as &#34;privileged,&#34; see

API for Privileged Blocks</a>.</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="a21495" id="a21495"><!-- --></a> <i>4.3</i>
Inheritence of Access Control Context</h3>
<a name="a22406" id="a22406"><!-- --></a> When a thread creates a
new thread, a new stack is created. If the current security context
was not retained when this new thread was created, then when
<code>AccessController.checkPermission</code> was called inside the
new thread, a security decision would be made based solely upon the
new thread&#39;s context, not taking into consideration that of the
parent thread.
<p><a name="a22435" id="a22435"><!-- --></a> This clean stack issue
would not be a security problem per se, but it would make the
writing of secure code, and especially system code, more prone to
subtle errors. For example, a non-expert developer might assume,
quite reasonably, that a child thread (e.g., one that does not
involve untrusted code) inherits the same security context from the
parent thread (e.g., one that involves untrusted code). This would
cause unintended security holes when accessing controlled resources
from inside the new thread (and then passing the resources along to
less trusted code), if the parent context was not in fact
saved.</p>
<p><a name="a22434" id="a22434"><!-- --></a> Thus, when a new
thread is created, we actually ensure (via thread creation and
other code) that it automatically inherits the parent thread&#39;s
security context at the time of creation of the child thread, in
such a way that subsequent <code>checkPermission</code> calls in
the child thread will take into consideration the inherited parent
context.</p>
<p><a name="a24860" id="a24860"><!-- --></a> In other words, the
logical thread context is expanded to include both the parent
context (in the form of an AccessControlContext, described in the
next section) and the current context, and the algorithm for
checking permissions is expanded to the following. (Recall there
are m callers up to the call to <code>checkPermission</code>, and
see the next section for information about the AccessControlContext
<code>checkPermission</code> method.)</p>
<pre>
 i = m;
 while (i &gt; 0) {
     if (caller i's domain does not have the permission)
         throw AccessControlException
     else if (caller i is marked as privileged) 
         return;
     i = i - 1;
 };

 // Next, check the context inherited when
 // the thread was created. Whenever a new thread is created, the
 // AccessControlContext at that time is
 // stored and associated with the new thread, as the "inherited"
 // context.

 inheritedContext.checkPermission(permission);
</pre>
<a name="a22454" id="a22454"><!-- --></a> Note that this
inheritance is transitive so that, for example, a grandchild
inherits both from the parent and the grandparent. Also note that
the inherited context snapshot is taken when the new child is
created, and not when the child is first run. There is no public
API change for the inheritance feature.<br />
<h3><a name="a22405" id="a22405"><!-- --></a> <i>4.4</i>
java.security.AccessControlContext</h3>
<a name="a21496" id="a21496"><!-- --></a> Recall that the
AccessController <code>checkPermission</code> method performs
security checks within the context of the current execution thread
(including the inherited context). A difficulty arises when such a
security check can only be done in a different context. That is,
sometimes a security check that should be made within a given
context will actually need to be done from within a
<em>different</em> context. For example, when one thread posts an
event to another thread, the second thread serving the requesting
event would not have the proper context to complete access control,
if the service requests access to controller resources.
<p><a name="a24928" id="a24928"><!-- --></a> To address this issue,
we provide the AccessController <code>getContext</code> method and
AccessControlContext class. The <code>getContext</code> method
takes a "snapshot" of the current calling context, and places it in
an AccessControlContext object, which it returns. A sample call is
the following:</p>
<pre>
AccessControlContext acc = AccessController.getContext();
</pre>
<a name="a24984" id="a24984"><!-- --></a> This context captures
relevant information so that an access control decision can be made
by checking, from within a different context, against this context
information. For example, one thread can post a request event to a
second thread, while also supplying this context information.
AccessControlContext itself has a <code>checkPermission</code>
method that makes access decisions based on the context <em>it</em>
encapsulates, rather than that of the current execution thread.
Thus, the second thread can perform an appropriate security check
if necessary by invoking the following:
<pre>
acc.checkPermission(permission);
</pre>
<a name="a21503" id="a21503"><!-- --></a> The above method call is
equivalent to performing the same security check in the context of
the first thread, even though it is done in the second thread.
<p><a name="a25011" id="a25011"><!-- --></a> There are also times
where one or more permissions must be checked against an access
control context, but it is unclear a priori which permissions are
to be checked. In these cases you can use the
<code>doPrivileged</code> method that takes a context:</p>
<pre>
  somemethod() {
        AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() {
             public Object run() {
                // Code goes here. Any permission checks from 
                // this point forward require both the current 
                // context and the snapshot's context to have 
                // the desired permission.
             }
        }, acc);
        ...normal code here...
</pre>
<a name="a28006" id="a28006"><!-- --></a> Now the complete
algorithm utilized by the AccessController
<code>checkPermission</code> method can be given. Suppose the
current thread traversed m callers, in the order of caller 1 to
caller 2 to caller m. Then caller m invoked the
<code>checkPermission</code> method. The algorithm
<code>checkPermission</code> uses to determine whether access is
granted or denied is the following
<pre>
  i = m;
  while (i &gt; 0) {
     if (caller i&#39;s domain does not have the permission)
        throw AccessControlException
     else if (caller i is marked as privileged) {
        if (a context was specified in the call to doPrivileged)
           context.checkPermission(permission);
        return;
     }
     i = i - 1;
  };


  // Next, check the context inherited when
  // the thread was created. Whenever a new thread is created, the
  // AccessControlContext at that time is
  // stored and associated with the new thread, as the "inherited"
  // context.

  inheritedContext.checkPermission(permission);
