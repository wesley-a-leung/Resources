<h2><a name="a19349" id="a19349"><i>6</i> Security
Management</a></h2>
<br />
<h3><a name="a28400" id="a28400"><!-- --></a> <i>6.1</i> Managing
Applets and Applications</h3>
<a name="a27265" id="a27265"><!-- --></a> Currently, all Java 2 SDK
system code invokes SecurityManager methods to check the policy
currently in effect and perform access control checks. There is
typically a security manager (SecurityManager implementation)
installed whenever an applet is running; the appletviewer and most
browsers, including those from Netscape and Microsoft, install a
security manager.
<p><a name="a27270" id="a27270"><!-- --></a> A security manager is
not automatically installed when an <em>application</em> is
running. To apply the same security policy to an application found
on the local file system as to downloaded applets, either the user
running the application must invoke the Java Virtual Machine with
the new &#34;-Djava.security.manager&#34; command-line argument
(which sets the value of the <em>java.security.manager</em>
property), as in</p>
<pre>
    java -Djava.security.manager  SomeApp
</pre>
<a name="a27277" id="a27277"><!-- --></a> or the application itself
must call the <code>setSecurityManager</code> method in the
java.lang.System class to install a security manager.
<p><a name="a27279" id="a27279"><!-- --></a> It is possible to
specify on the command line a particular security manager to be
utilized, by following &#34;-Djava.security.manager&#34; with an
equals and the name of the class to be used as the security
manager, as in</p>
<pre>
    java -Djava.security.manager=COM.abc.MySecMgr  SomeApp
</pre>
<a name="a27283" id="a27283"><!-- --></a> If no security manager is
specified, the built-in default security manager is utilized
(unless the application installs a different security manager). All
of the following are equivalent and result in usage of the default
security manager:
<pre>
    java -Djava.security.manager  SomeApp
    java -Djava.security.manager=""  SomeApp
    java -Djava.security.manager=default  SomeApp
</pre>
<a name="a27289" id="a27289"><!-- --></a> Java 2 SDK includes a
property named <em>java.class.path</em>. Classes that are stored on
the local file system but should not be treated as base classes
(e.g., classes built into the SDK) should be on this path. Classes
on this path are loaded with a secure class loader and are thus
subjected to the security policy being enforced.
<p><a name="a27294" id="a27294"><!-- --></a> There is also a
&#34;-Djava.security.policy&#34; command-line argument whose usage
determines what policy files are utilized. This command-line
argument is described in detail in the "Default System and User
Policy Files" section. Basically, if you don't include
&#34;-Djava.security.policy&#34; on the command line, then the
policy files specified in the security properties file will be
used.</p>
<p><a name="a27299" id="a27299"><!-- --></a> You can use a
&#34;-Djava.security.policy&#34; command-line argument to specify
an additional or a different policy file when invoking execution of
an application. For example, if you type the following, where
<em>pURL</em> is a URL specifying the location of a policy file,
then the specified policy file will be loaded in addition to all
the policy files specified in the security properties file:</p>
<pre>
    java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=<em>pURL</em> SomeApp
</pre>
<a name="a27304" id="a27304"><!-- --></a> If you instead type the
following command, using a double equals, then just the specified
policy file will be used; all others will be ignored:
<pre>
java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==pURL SomeApp
</pre>
<br />
<h3><a name="a28195" id="a28195"><!-- --></a> <i>6.2</i>
SecurityManager versus AccessController</h3>
<a name="a28196" id="a28196"><!-- --></a> The new access control
mechanism is fully backward compatible. For example, all
<code>check</code> methods in SecurityManager are still supported,
although most of their implementations are changed to call the new
SecurityManager <code>checkPermission</code> method, whose default
implementation calls the AccessController
<code>checkPermission</code> method. Note that certain internal
security checks may stay in the SecurityManager class, unless it
can be parameterized.
<p><a name="a28197" id="a28197"><!-- --></a> We have not at this
time revised any system code to call AccessController instead of
calling SecurityManager (and checking for the existence of a
classloader), because of the potential of existing third-party
applications that subclass the SecurityManager and customize the
<code>check</code> methods. In fact, we added a new method
<code>SecurityManager.checkPermission</code> that by default simply
invokes <code>AccessController.checkPermission</code>.</p>
<p><a name="a28198" id="a28198"><!-- --></a> To understand the
relationship between SecurityManager and AccessController, it is
sufficient to note that SecurityManager represents the concept of a
central point of access control, while AccessController implements
a particular access control algorithm, with special features such
as the <code>doPrivileged</code> method. By keeping SecurityManager
up to date, we maintain backward compatibility (e.g., for those
applications that have written their own security manager classes
based on earlier versions of the JDK) and flexibility (e.g., for
someone wanting to customize the security model to implement
mandatory access control or multilevel security). By providing
AccessController, we build in the algorithm that we believe is the
most restrictive and that relieves the typical programmer from the
burden of having to write extensive security code in most
scenarios.</p>
<p><a name="a28199" id="a28199"><!-- --></a> We encourage the use
of AccessController in application code, while customization of a
security manager (via subclassing) should be the last resort and
should be done with extreme care. Moreover, a customized security
manager, such as one that always checks the time of the day before
invoking standard security checks, could and should utilize the
algorithm provided by AccessController whenever appropriate.</p>

<p>One thing to remember is that, when you implement your own <code>SecurityManager</code>, you should install it as trusted software and grant it <code>java.security.AllPermission</code>. There are several ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can install your <code>SecurityManager</code> as an extension, because all extensions are granted <code>AllPermission</code> by default. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/index.html">Lesson: Creating and Using Extensions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can adjust the policy file to grant <code>AllPermission</code> to your <code>SecurityManager</code>. For more information, see <a href="../PolicyFiles.html">Default Policy Implementation and Policy File Syntax</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="a18540" id="a18540"><!-- --></a> <i>6.3</i> Auxiliary
Tools</h3>
<a name="a21606" id="a21606"><!-- --></a> This section briefly
describes the usage of three tools that assist in the deployment of
the new security features. These tools may be packaged together in
the future.
<a name="a27533" id="a27533"><!-- --></a>
<h4><i>6.3.1 The Key and Certificate Management Tool</i></h4>
<a name="a27534" id="a27534"><!-- --></a> <b>keytool</b> is a key
and certificate management utility. It enables users to administer
their own public/private key pairs and associated certificates for
use in self-authentication (where the user authenticates
himself/herself to other users/services) or data integrity and
authentication services, using digital signatures. The
authentication information includes both a sequence (chain) of
X.509 certificates, and an associated private key, which can be
referenced by a so-called &#34;alias&#34;. This tool also manages
certificates (that are &#34;trusted&#34; by the user), which are
stored in the same database as the authentication information, and
can be referenced by an &#34;alias&#34;.
<p><a name="a25949" id="a25949"><!-- --></a> <b>keytool</b> stores
the keys and certificates in a so-called <em>keystore</em>. The
default keystore implementation implements the keystore as a file.
It protects private keys with a password.</p>
<p><a name="a25960" id="a25960"><!-- --></a> The chains of X.509
certificates are provided by organizations called Certification
Authorities, or CAs. Identities (including CAs) use their private
keys to authenticate their association with objects (such as with
channels which are secured using SSL), with archives of code they
signed, or (for CAs) with X.509 certificates they have issued. As a
bootstrapping tool, certificates generated using the -genkey
command may be used until a Certification Authority returns a
certificate chain.</p>
<p><a name="a21737" id="a21737"><!-- --></a> The private keys in
this database are always stored in encrypted form, to make it
difficult to disclose these private keys inappropriately. A
password is required to access or modify the database. These
private keys are encrypted using the &#34;password&#34;, which
should be several words long. If the password is lost, those
authentication keys cannot be recovered.</p>
<p><a name="a22788" id="a22788"><!-- --></a> In fact, each private
key in the keystore can be protected using its own individual
password, which may or may not be the same as the password that
protects the keystore&#39;s overall integrity.</p>
<p><a name="a21768" id="a21768"><!-- --></a> This tool is
(currently) intended to be used from the command line, where one
simply types &#34;keytool&#34; as a shell prompt. <b>keytool</b> is
a script that executes the appropriate Java classes and is built
together with the SDK.</p>
<p><a name="a21774" id="a21774"><!-- --></a> The command line
options for each command may be provided in any order. Typing an
incorrect option or typing &#34;keytool -help&#34; will cause the
tool&#39;s usage to be summarized on the output device (such as a
shell window), as given below.</p>

<h4><i>6.3.2 PolicyTool</i></h4>
<a name="a22176" id="a22176"><!-- --></a> The <b>PolicyTool</b> is
a graphical user interface (illustrated below with a screen shot)
that assists a user (such as a system administrator) in specifying,
generating, editing, exporting, or importing a security policy. The
tool is invoked from the command line as <code>policytool</code>.
This again is a script built with the SDK that invokes the
appropriate (non-public) implementation classes.
<p><a name="a27674" id="a27674"><!-- --></a> See the
<b>PolicyTool</b> documentation for usage information and examples
with up-to-date screen shots. The documentation can be found in the

<h4><i>6.3.3 The JAR Signing and Verification Tool</i></h4>
<a name="a21612" id="a21612"><!-- --></a> The <b>jarsigner</b> tool
can be used to digitally sign Java archives (JAR files), and to
verify such signatures. This tool, like the <b>PolicyTool</b>,
depends on the keystore that is managed by the <b>keytool</b>. Its
usage is quickly summarized below.
<pre>
% jarsigner
Usage: jarsigner [options] jar-file alias
       jarsigner -verify [options] jar-file
  [-keystore &lt;url&gt;]         keystore file location
  [-storepass &lt;password&gt;]   password for keystore integrity
  [-keypass &lt;password&gt;]     password for private key (if different)
  [-sigfile &lt;file&gt;]         name of .SF/.DSA file
  [-signedjar &lt;file&gt;]       name of signed JAR file
  [-verify]                 verify a signed JAR file
  [-verbose]                verbose output when signing/verifying
  [-certs]          display certificates when verbose and verifying
  [-internalsf]             include .SF file inside signature block
  [-sectionsonly]           don&#39;t compute hash of entire manifest
</pre>
<a name="a22622" id="a22622"><!-- --></a> Again, this tool is a
script built with the SDK. Note that it is expected that this tool
and the existing <em>jar</em> tool script may be merged in the near
future to form a single command-line primitive to create JARs,
either signed or unsigned.<br />
