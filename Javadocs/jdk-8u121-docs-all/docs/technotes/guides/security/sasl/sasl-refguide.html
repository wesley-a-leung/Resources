<h2><a name="INTRO" id="INTRO">Introduction</a></h2>
<h2><a name="WHAT" id="WHAT">What is SASL?</a></h2>
Simple Authentication and Security Layer, or SASL, is an Internet
standard (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">RFC
2222</a>) that specifies a protocol for authentication and optional
establishment of a security layer between client and server
applications. SASL defines how authentication data is to be
exchanged but does not itself specify the contents of that data. It
is a framework into which specific <em>authentication
mechanisms</em> that specify the contents and semantics of the
authentication data can fit.
<p>SASL is used by protocols, such as the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol, version 3 (<a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt">LDAP v3</a>), and the
Internet Message Access Protocol, version 4 (<a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2060.txt">IMAP v4</a>) to enable
pluggable authentication. Instead of hardwiring an authentication
method into the protocol, LDAP v3 and IMAP v4 use SASL to perform
authentication, thus enabling authentication via various SASL
mechanisms.</p>
<p>There are a number of standard SASL mechanisms defined by the
Internet community for various levels of security and deployment
scenarios. These range from no security (e.g., anonymous
authentication) to high security (e.g., Kerberos authentication)
and levels in between.</p>
<h2><a name="SASLAPI" id="SASLAPI">The Java SASL API</a></h2>
The Java SASL API defines classes and interfaces for applications
that use SASL mechanisms. It is defined to be mechanism-neutral:
the application that uses the API need not be hardwired into using
any particular SASL mechanism. The API supports both client and
server applications. It allows applications to select the mechanism
to use based on desired security features, such as whether they are
susceptible to passive dictionary attacks or whether they accept
anonymous authentication.
<p>The Java SASL API also allows developers to use their own,
custom SASL mechanisms. SASL mechanisms are installed by using the
<a href="../crypto/CryptoSpec.html#ProviderInstalling">Java
Cryptography Architecture</a> (JCA).</p>
<h2><a name="WHEN" id="WHEN">When to Use SASL</a></h2>
SASL provides pluggable authentication and security layer for
network applications. There are other features in the Java SE that
provide similar functionality, including the <a href=
"../jsse/JSSERefGuide.html">Java Secure Socket Extension</a>
(JSSE), and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2853.txt">Java
Generic Security Service</a> (Java GSS). JSSE provides a framework
and an implementation for a Java language version of the SSL and
TLS protocols. 
<!-- <a href=http://home.netscape.com/eng/ssl3/ssl-toc.html>SSL</a>
and <a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt>TLS</a> protocols. -->
Java GSS is the Java language bindings for the Generic Security
Service Application Programming Interface (<a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2743.txt">GSS-API</a>). The only
mechanism currently supported underneath this API on Java SE is
Kerberos v5.
<p>When compared with JSSE and Java GSS, SASL is relatively
lightweight and is popular among more recent protocols. It also has
the advantage that several popular, lightweight (in terms
infrastructure support) SASL mechanisms have been defined. Primary
JSSE and Java GSS mechanisms, on the other hand, have relatively
heavyweight mechanisms that require more elaborate infrastructures
(Public Key Infrastructure and Kerberos, respectively).</p>
<p>SASL, JSSE, and Java GSS are often used together. For example, a
common pattern is for an application to use JSSE for establishing a
secure channel, and to use SASL for client, username/password-based
authentication. There are also SASL mechanisms layered on top of
GSS-API mechanisms; one popular example is a SASL GSS-API/Kerberos
v5 mechanism that is used with LDAP.</p>
<p>Except when defining and building protocols from scratch, often
the biggest factor determining which API to use is the protocol
definition. For example, LDAP and IMAP are defined to use SASL, so
software related to these protocols should use the Java SASL API.
When building Kerberos applications and services, the API to use is
Java GSS. When building applications and services that use SSL/TLS
as their protocol, the API to use is JSSE. See the <a href=
"../jgss/tutorials/JGSSvsJSSE.html">Java Security Documentation</a>
for further details about when to use JSSE versus Java GSS.</p>
<h2><a name="API" id="API">API Overview</a></h2>
SASL is a challenge-response protocol. The server issues a
challenge to the client, and the client sends a response based on
the challenge. This exchange continues until the server is
satisfied and issues no further challenge. These challenges and
responses are binary tokens of arbitrary length. The encapsulating
protocol (such as LDAP or IMAP) specifies how these tokens are
encoded and exchanged. For example, LDAP specifies how SASL tokens
are encapsulated within LDAP bind requests and responses.
<p>The Java SASL API is modeled according to this style of
interaction and usage. It has interfaces, <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslClient.html"><tt>SaslClient</tt></a>
and <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslServer.html"><tt>SaslServer</tt></a>,
that represent client-side and server-side mechanisms,
respectively. The application interacts with the mechanisms via
byte arrays that represent the challenges and responses. The
server-side mechanism iterates, issuing challenges and processing
responses, until it is satisfied, while the client-side mechanism
iterates, evaluating challenges and issuing responses, until the
server is satisfied. The application that is using the mechanism
drives each iteration. That is, it extracts the challenge or
response from a protocol packet and supplies it to the mechanism,
and then puts the response or challenge returned by the mechanism
into a protocol packet and sends it to the peer.</p>
<h2><a name="CREATE" id="CREATE">Creating the Mechanisms</a></h2>
The client and server code that uses the SASL mechanisms are not
hardwired to use specific mechanism(s). In many protocols that use
SASL, the server advertises (either statically or dynamically) a
list of SASL mechanisms that it supports. The client then selects
one of these based on its security requirements.
<p>The <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html"><tt>Sasl</tt></a>
class is used for creating instances of <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslClient.html"><tt>SaslClient</tt></a>
and <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslServer.html"><tt>SaslServer</tt></a>.
Here is an example of how an application creates a SASL client
mechanism using a list of possible SASL mechanisms.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
String[] mechanisms = new String[]{"DIGEST-MD5", "PLAIN"}; 
SaslClient sc = Sasl.createSaslClient(mechanisms, authzid, protocol, 
                serverName, props, callbackHandler);
</pre>
<p>Based on the availability of the mechanisms supported by the
platform and other configuration information provided via the
parameters, the Java SASL framework selects one of the listed
mechanisms and return an instance of <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslClient.html"><tt>SaslClient</tt></a>.</p>
<p>The name of the selected mechanism is usually transmitted to the
server via the application protocol. Upon receiving the mechanism
name, the server creates a corresponding <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslServer.html"><tt>SaslServer</tt></a>
object to process client-sent responses. Here is an example of how
the server would create an instance of <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslServer.html"><tt>SaslServer</tt></a>.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
SaslServer ss = Sasl.createSaslServer(mechanism, protocol, 
                  myName, props, callbackHandler);
</pre>
<h2><a name="INPUT" id="INPUT">Passing Input to the
Mechanisms</a></h2>
<p>Because the Java SASL API is a general framework, it must be
able to accommodate many different types of mechanisms. Each
mechanism needs to be initialized with input and may need input to
make progress. The API provides three means by which an application
gives input to a mechanism.</p>
<ol>
<li>Common input parameters. The application uses predefined
parameters to supply information that are defined by the SASL
specification and commonly required by mechanisms. For <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#createSaslClient-java.lang.String:A-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.util.Map-javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler-">
SASL client mechanisms</a>, the input parameters are authorization
id, protocol id, and server name. For <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#createSaslServer-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.util.Map-javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler-">
SASL server mechanisms</a>, the common input parameters are
prototol id and (its own fully qualified) server name.</li>
<li>Properties parameter. The application uses the properties
parameter, a mapping of property names to (possibly non-string)
property values, to supply configuration information. The Java SASL
API defines some standard properties, such as <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#QOP">quality-of-protection</a>,
<a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#STRENGTH">cipher
strength</a>, and <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#MAX_BUFFER">maximum
buffer size</a>. The parameter can also be used to pass in
non-standard properties that are specific to particular
mechanisms.</li>
<li>Callbacks. The application uses the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/auth/callback/CallbackHandler.html">
callback handler</a> parameter to supply input that cannot be
predetermined or might not be common across mechanisms. When a
mechanism requires input data, it uses the callback handler
supplied by the application to collect the data, possibly from the
end-user of the application. For example, a mechanism might require
the end-user of the application to supply a name and password.
<p>Mechanisms can use the callbacks defined in the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/auth/callback/package-summary.html">
<tt>javax.security.auth.callback</tt></a> package; these are
generic callbacks useful for building applications that perform
authentication. Mechanisms might also need SASL-specific callbacks,
such as those for collecting realm and authorization information,
or even (non-standardized) mechanism-specific callbacks. The
application should be able to accommodate a variety of mechanisms.
Consequently, its callback handler must be able to service all of
the callbacks that the mechanisms might request. This is not
possible in general for arbitrary mechanisms, but is usually
feasible due to the limited number of mechanisms that are typically
deployed and used.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="USE" id="USE">Using the Mechanisms</a></h2>
Once the application has created a mechanism, it uses the mechanism
to obtain SASL tokens to exchange with the peer. The client
typically indicates to the server via the application protocol
which mechanism to use. Some protocols allows the client to
accompany the request with an optional <em>initial response</em>
for mechanisms that have an initial response. This feature can be
used to lower the number of message exchanges required for
authentication. Here is an example of how a client might use
<a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslClient.html"><tt>SaslClient</tt></a>
for authentication.
<pre class="codeblock">
// Get optional initial response
byte[] response = 
    (sc.hasInitialResponse() ? sc.evaluateChallenge(new byte[]) : null);

String mechanism = sc.getMechanismName();

// Send selected mechanism name and optional initial response to server
send(mechanism, response);

// Read response
msg = receive();
while (!sc.isComplete() &amp;&amp; (msg.status == CONTINUE || msg.status == SUCCESS)) {
    // Evaluate server challenge
    response = sc.evaluateChallenge(msg.contents);

    if (msg.status == SUCCESS) {
        // done; server doesn't expect any more SASL data
        if (response != null) {
           throw new IOException(
               "Protocol error: attempting to send response after completion");
        }
        break;
    } else {
        send(mechanism, response);
        msg = receive();
    }
</pre>
<p>The client application iterates through each step of the
authentication by using the mechanism (<tt>sc</tt>) to evaluate the
challenge gotten from the server and to get a response to send back
to the server. It continues this cycle until either the mechanism
or application-level protocol indicates that the authentication has
completed, or if the mechanism cannot evaluate a challenge. If the
mechanism cannot evaluate the challenge, it throws an exception to
indicate the error and terminates the authentication. Disagreement
between the mechanism and protocol about the completion state must
be treated as an error because it might indicate a compromise of
the authentication exchange.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how a server might use <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslServer.html"><tt>SaslServer</tt></a>.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
// Read request that contains mechanism name and optional initial response
msg.receive();

// Obtain a SaslServer to perform authentication
SaslServer ss = Sasl.createSaslServer(msg.mechanism, 
    protocol, myName, props, callbackHandler);

// Perform authentication steps until done
while (!ss.isComplete()) {
    try {
        // Process response
        byte[] challenge = sc.evaluateResponse(msg.contents);

        if (ss.isComplete()) {
            send(mechanism, challenge, SUCCESS);
        } else {
            send(mechanism, challenge, CONTINUE);
            msg.receive();
        }
    } catch (SaslException e) {
        send(ERROR);
        sc.dispose();
        break;
    }
}
</pre>
The server application iterates through each step of the
authentication by giving the client's response to the mechanism
(<tt>ss</tt>) to process. If the response is incorrect, the
mechanism indicates the error by throwing a <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslException.html"><tt>SaslException</tt></a>
so that the server can report the error and terminate the
authentication. If the response is correct, the mechanism returns
challenge data to be sent to the client and indicates whether the
authentication is complete. Note that challenge data can accompany
a "success" indication. This might be used, for example, to tell
the client to finalize some negotiated state.
<h2><a name="LAYER" id="LAYER">Using the Negotiated Security
Layer</a></h2>
Some SASL mechanisms support only authentication while others
support use of a negotiated security layer after authentication.
The security layer feature is often not used when the application
uses some other means, such as SSL/TLS, to communicate securely
with the peer.
<p>When a security layer has been negotiated, all subsequent
communication with the peer must take place using the security
layer. To determine whether a security layer has been negotiated,
get the negotiated <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#QOP">quality-of-protection</a>
(QOP) from the mechanism. Here is an example of how to determine
whether a security layer has been negotiated.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
String qop = (String) sc.getNegotiatedProperty(Sasl.QOP);
boolean hasSecurityLayer = (qop != null &amp;&amp; 
    (qop.equals("auth-int") || qop.equals("auth-conf")));
</pre>
<p>A security layer has been negotiated if the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#QOP"><tt>Sasl.QOP</tt></a>
property indicates that either integrity and/or confidentiality has
been negotiated.</p>
<p>To communicate with the peer using the negotiated layer, the
application first uses the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslClient.html#wrap-byte:A-int-int-">
<tt>wrap</tt></a> method to encode the data to be sent to the peer
to produce a "wrapped" buffer. It then transfers a length field
representing the number of octets in the wrapped buffer followed by
the contents of the wrapped buffer to the peer. The peer receiving
the stream of octets passes the buffer (without the length field)
to <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslClient.html#unwrap-byte:A-int-int-">
<tt>unwrap</tt></a> to obtain the decoded bytes sent by the peer.
Details of this protocol are described in <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">RFC 2222</a>. Here is an
example of how a client application sends and receives application
data using a security layer.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
// Send outgoing application data to peer
byte[] outgoing = ...;
byte[] netOut = sc.wrap(outgoing, 0, outgoing.length);

send(netOut.length, netOut);   // send to peer

// Receive incoming application data from peer
byte[] netIn = receive();      // read length and ensuing bytes from peer

byte[] incoming = sc.unwrap(netIn, 0, netIn.length);
</pre>
<h2><a name="INSTALL" id="INSTALL">How SASL Mechanisms are
Installed and Selected</a></h2>
SASL mechanism implementations are provided by SASL security
providers. Each provider may support one or more SASL mechanisms
and is registered with the <a href="../crypto/CryptoSpec.html">Java
Cryptography Architecture (JCA)</a>. By default, in J2SE 5, the
SunSASL provider is automatically registered as a JCA provider. To
remove it or reorder its priority as a JCA provider, change the
line
<pre class="codeblock">
security.provider.7=com.sun.security.sasl.Provider
</pre>
in the Java Security Properties file
($JAVA_HOME/lib/security/java.security).
<p>To add or remove a SASL provider, you add or remove the
corresponding line in the Security Properties file. For example, if
you want to add a SASL provider and have its mechanisms be chosen
over the same ones implemented by the SunSASL provider, then you
would add a line to the Security Properties file with a lower
number.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
security.provider.7=com.example.MyProvider
security.provider.8=com.sun.security.sasl.Provider
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can programmatically add your own provider
using the <a href=
"../../../../api/java/security/Security.html"><tt>java.security.Security</tt></a>
class. For example, the following sample code registers the
<tt>com.example.MyProvider</tt> to the list of available SASL
security providers.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Security.addProvider(new com.example.MyProvider());
</pre>
When an application requests a SASL mechanism by supplying one or
more mechanism names, the SASL framework looks for registered SASL
providers that support that mechanism by going through, in order,
the list of registered providers. The providers must then determine
whether the requested mechanism matches the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT">selection
policy properties</a> and if so, return an implementation for the
mechanism.
<p>The selection policy properties specify the security aspects of
a mechanism, such as its susceptibility to certain attacks. These
are characteristics of the mechanism (definition), rather than its
implementation so all providers should come to the same conclusion
about a particular mechanism. For example, the PLAIN mechanism is
susceptible to plaintext attacks regardless of how it is
implemented. If no selection policy properties are supplied, there
are no restrictions on the selected mechanism. Using these
properties, an application can ensure that it does not use
unsuitable mechanisms that might be deployed in the execution
environment. For example, an application might use the following
sample code if it does not want to allow the use of mechanisms
susceptible to plaintext attacks.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Map props = new HashMap();
props.add(Sasl.POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT, "true");
SaslClient sc = Sasl.createSaslClient(mechanisms,
    authzid, protocol, serverName, props, callbackHandler);
</pre>
See the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html"><tt>Sasl</tt></a>
class for descriptions of the selection policy properties.

<p>An application that uses these mechanisms from the SunSASL
provider must supply the required parameters, callbacks and
properties. The properties have reasonable defaults and only need
to be set if the application wants to override the defaults. Most
of the parameters, callbacks, and properties are described in the
API documentation. The following sections describe
mechanism-specific behaviors and parameters not already covered by
the API documentation.</p>
<h3><a name="CRAMCLNT" id="CRAMCLNT">Cram-MD5</a></h3>
<p>The Cram-MD5 client mechanism uses the authorization id
parameter, if supplied, as the default username in the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/auth/callback/NameCallback.html"><code>
NameCallback</code></a> to solicit the application/end-user for the
authentication id. The authorization id is otherwise not used by
the Cram-MD5 mechanism; only the authentication id is exchanged
with the server.</p>
<h3><a name="DIGESTCLNT" id="DIGESTCLNT">Digest-MD5</a></h3>
<p>The Digest-MD5 mechanism is used for digest authentication and
optional establishment of a security layer. It specifies the
following ciphers for use with the security layer: Triple DES, DES
and RC4 (128, 56, and 40 bits). The Digest-MD5 mechanism can
support only ciphers that are available on the platform. For
example, if the platform does not support the RC4 ciphers, then the
Digest-MD5 mechanism will not use those ciphers.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#STRENGTH"><tt>Sasl.STRENGTH</tt></a>
property supports "high", "medium", and "low" settings; its default
is "high,medium,low". The ciphers are mapped to the strength
settings as follows.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" width="100%" summary=
"ciphers mapped to the strength settings">
<tr>
<th id="h101">Strength</th>
<th id="h102">Cipher</th>
<th id="h103">Cipher Id</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="h101">high</td>
<td headers="h102">Triple&nbsp;DES<br />
RC4&nbsp;128&nbsp;bits</td>
<td headers="h103">3des rc4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="h101">medium</td>
<td headers="h102">DES<br />
RC4&nbsp;56&nbsp;bits</td>
<td headers="h103">des rc4-56</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="h101">low</td>
<td headers="h102">RC4&nbsp;40&nbsp;bits</td>
<td headers="h103">rc4-40</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>When there is more than one choice for a particular strength,
the cipher selected depends on the availability of the ciphers in
the underlying platform. To explicitly name the cipher to use, set
the "com.sun.security.sasl.digest.cipher" property to the
corresponding cipher id. Note that this property setting must be
compatible with <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#STRENGTH"><tt>Sasl.STRENGTH</tt></a>
and the ciphers available in the underlying platform. For example,
<a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#STRENGTH"><tt>Sasl.STRENGTH</tt></a>
being set to "low" and "com.sun.security.sasl.digest.cipher" being
set to "3des" are incompatible. The
"com.sun.security.sasl.digest.cipher" property has no default.</p>
<p>The "javax.security.sasl.sendmaxbuffer" property specifies (the
string representation of) the maximum send buffer size in bytes.
The default is 65536. The actual maximum number of bytes will be
the minimum of this number and the peer's maximum receive buffer
size.</p>
<h3><a name="GSSAPICLNT" id="GSSAPICLNT">GSSAPI</a></h3>
The GSSAPI mechanism is used for Kerberos v5 authentication and
optional establishment of a security layer. The mechanism expects
the calling thread's <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html"><code>Subject</code></a>
to contain the client's Kerberos credentials or that the
credentials could be obtained by implicitly logging in to Kerberos.
To obtain the client's Kerberos credentials, use the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jaas/index.html">Java Authentication and
Authorization Service (JAAS)</a> to log in using the Kerberos login
module. See the <a href="../jgss/tutorials/index.html">Java GSS-API
and JAAS Tutorials for Use with Kerberos</a> for details and
examples. After using JAAS authentication to obtain the Kerberos
credentials, you put the code that uses the SASL GSSAPI mechanism
within <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html#doAs-javax.security.auth.Subject-java.security.PrivilegedAction-">
<tt>doAs</tt></a> or <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html#doAsPrivileged-javax.security.auth.Subject-java.security.PrivilegedAction-java.security.AccessControlContext-">
<tt>doAsPrivileged</tt></a>.
<pre class="codeblock">
LoginContext lc = new LoginContext("JaasSample", new TextCallbackHandler());
lc.login();
lc.getSubject().doAs(new SaslAction());

class SaslAction implements java.security.PrivilegedAction {
   public class run() {
       ...
       String[] mechanisms = new String[]{"GSSAPI"};
       SaslClient sc = Sasl.createSaslClient(mechanisms,
           authzid, protocol, serverName, props, callbackHandler);
       ...
   }
}
</pre>
To obtain Kerberos credentials without doing explicit JAAS
programming, see the <a href="../jgss/tutorials/index.html">Java
GSS-API and JAAS Tutorials for Use with Kerberos</a>. When using
this approach, there is no need to wrap the code within <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html#doAs-javax.security.auth.Subject-java.security.PrivilegedAction-">
<tt>doAs</tt></a> or <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html#doAsPrivileged-javax.security.auth.Subject-java.security.PrivilegedAction-java.security.AccessControlContext-">
<tt>doAsPrivileged</tt></a>.
<p>The "javax.security.sasl.sendmaxbuffer" property specifies (the
string representation of) the maximum send buffer size in bytes.
The default is 65536. The actual maximum number of bytes will be
the minimum of this number and the peer's maximum receive buffer
size.</p>

<h2><a name="PROV" id="PROV">Implementing a SASL Security
Provider</a></h2>
There are three basic steps in implementing a SASL security
provider.
<ol>
<li>Write a class that implements the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslClient.html"><tt>SaslClient</tt></a>
or <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslServer.html"><tt>SaslServer</tt></a>
interface.</li>
<li>Write a factory class (that implements <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslClientFactory.html"><tt>SaslClientFactory</tt></a>
or <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslServerFactory.html"><tt>SaslServerFactory</tt></a>)
that creates instances of the class.</li>
<li>Write a JCA provider that registers the factory.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step involves providing an implementation for the SASL
mechanism. To implement a client mechanism, you need to implement
the methods declared in the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslClient.html"><tt>SaslClient</tt></a>
interface. Similarly, for a server mechanism, you need to implement
the methods declared in the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslServer.html"><tt>SaslServer</tt></a>
interface. For the purposes of this discussion, suppose you are
developing an implementation for the client mechanism
"SAMPLE-MECH", implemented by the class,
<tt>com.example.SampleMechClient</tt>. You must decide what input
are needed by the mechanism and how the implementation is going to
collect them. For example, if the mechanism is
username/password-based, then the implementation would likely need
to collect that information via the callback handler parameter.</p>
<p>The next step involves providing a factory class that will
create instances of <tt>com.example.SampleMechClient</tt>. The
factory needs to determine the characteristics of the mechanism
that it supports (as described by the <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/Sasl.html#POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT"><tt>
Sasl.POLICY_*</tt></a> properties) so that it can return an
instance of the mechanism when the API user requests it using
compatible policy properties. The factory may also check for
validity of the parameters before creating the mechanism. For the
purposes of this discussion, suppose the factory class is named
<tt>com.example.MySampleClientFactory</tt>. Although our sample
factory is responsible for only one mechanism, a single factory can
be responsible for any number of mechanisms.</p>
<p>The final step involves creating a JCA provider. The steps for
creating a JCA provider is described in detail in the document,
<a href="../crypto/HowToImplAProvider.html">How to Implement a
Provider for the Java Cryptography Architecture</a>. SASL client
factories are registered using property names of the form</p>
<p><tt>SaslClientFactory.</tt><em>mechName</em></p>
while SASL server factories are registered using property names of
the form
<p><tt>SaslServerFactory.</tt><em>mechName</em></p>
<p><em>mechName</em> is the SASL mechanism's name. This is what's
returned by <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslClient.html#getMechanismName--">
<tt>SaslClient.getMechanismName()</tt></a> and <a href=
"../../../../api/javax/security/sasl/SaslServer.html#getMechanismName--">
<tt>SaslServer.getMechanismName()</tt></a>. Continuing with our
example, here is how the provider would register the "SAMPLE-MECH"
mechanism.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
put("SaslClientFactory.SAMPLE-MECH", "com.example.MySampleClientFactory");
</pre>
<p>A single SASL provider might be responsible for many mechanisms.
Therefore, it might have many invocations of <a href=
"../../../../api/java/security/Provider.html#put-java.lang.Object-java.lang.Object-">
<tt>put</tt></a> to register the relevant factories. The completed
SASL provider can then be made available to applications using the
instructions given <a href="#INSTALL">previously</a>.</p>
