<h1><a name="PART1" id="PART1">Part I : Secure Authentication using
the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS)</a></h1>
<h2><a name="JAAS" id="JAAS"></a>Exercise 1 : Using
the JAAS API</h2>
<h3>Goal of this exercise</h3>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to learn how to use the Java
Authentication and Authorization (JAAS) API to perform
authentication.<br /></p>
<h3>Background for this exercise</h3>
<p>JAAS provides a standard pluggable authentication framework
(PAM) for the Java platform. &nbsp;An application uses the JAAS API
to perform <i>authentication</i> - the process of verifying the
identity of the user who is using the application and gathering his
identity information into a container called a <i>subject</i>. The
application can then use the identity information in the subject
along with the JAAS API to make <i>authorization</i> decisions, to
decide whether the authenticated user is allowed to access
protected resources or perform restricted actions. This exercise
demonstrates JAAS Authentication. It does not demonstrate JAAS
Authorization.</p>

<li><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B12428_15/tour/security_jaas.htm">Java Authentication and Authorization Service</a><br /></li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to follow</h3>
<ol>
<li><a name="JAAScode" id="JAAScode"></a><p>Read the <a href=
"src/Jaas.java">Jaas.java</a> sample code. The code performs the following
tasks:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Define a callback handler or use a predefined one.</li>
<li>Create a LoginContext with a name that identifies which JAAS
configuration entry to use.</li>
<li>Perform the authentication.</li>
<li>Define the task that the authenticated user is to perform.</li>
<li>Perform the action as the authenticated user.</li>
<li>Log out.<br /></li>
</ol>
<p><code>Subject.doAs</code> will run the code defined in
<code>MyAction</code> as the authenticated user [lines 14-15]. This
serves two purposes. First, code in <code>MyAction</code> that requires
identity information for authentication to a service could get it
from the subject. This exercise demonstrates this use. Second, if
<code>MyAction</code> accesses any protected resources/operations, the
identity information in the current subject would be used to make
the corresponding access control decision. This second aspect is
not covered in this exercise.</p></li>
<li>Make sure that the <code>%JAVA_HOME%/bin</code> is in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable.</li>
<li>Compile the modified sample code. You will run this code in subsequent exercises after doing some set
up. That ends this exercise.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This exercise introduced the main classes of the JAAS APIs:
<code>LoginContext</code> and <code>Subject</code>. You learned how
to use <code>LoginContext</code> to authenticate a user and collect
its identity information in a <code>Subject</code>. You then
learned how to use the <code>Subject</code> to perform an action as
the authenticated user.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Proceed to <a href="#JAASKRB5">Exercise 2</a> to learn how to
configure the sample application to use Kerberos for
authentication.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="JAASKRB5" id="JAASKRB5"></a>Exercise
2: Configuring JAAS for Kerberos Authentication</h2>
<h3>Goal of this exercise</h3>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to learn how to configure a JAAS
application to use Kerberos for authentication. <a name="KRB5BG"
id="KRB5BG"></a></p>
<h3>Kerberos Background for this exercise</h3>
<p>Kerberos is an Internet standard protocol for trusted-third
party authentication defined in <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4120.txt">RFC 4120</a>. It is available
on most modern computing platforms today, including Solaris,
Windows XP, and Linux.</p>
<p>The Kerberos architecture is centered around a trusted
authentication service called the key distribution center, or KDC.
Users and services in a Kerberos environment are referred to as
principals; each principal shares a secret (such as a password)
with the KDC. A principal &nbsp;authenticates to Kerberos by
proving to the KDC that it knows the shared secret. If the
authentication is successful, the KDC issues a
ticket-granting-ticket (TGT) to the principal. When the principal
subsequently wants to authenticate to a service on the network,
such as a directory service or a file service, (thereby, acting as
a "client" of the service), it gives the TGT to the KDC to obtain a
service ticket to communicate with the service. Not only does the
service ticket indicate the identities of the client and service
principals, it also contains a session key that can be used by the
client and service to subsequently establish secure communication.
To authenticate to the service, the client sends the service ticket
to the service. When the service receives the ticket, it decodes it
using the secret it shares with the KDC.</p>
<p>
In this architecture, a principal only authenticates directly
(once) to the KDC. It authenticates indirectly to all other
services via the use of service tickets. Service tickets are how
the KDC vouches for the identity of a principal. The ability of a
principal to access multiple secure services by performing explicit
authentication only once is called single sign-on.</p>
<h3>JAAS Background for this exercise:</h3>
<p>
In JAAS, for a client principal, "logging into Kerberos" means
acquiring the TGT and placing it in the <code>Subject</code>, so
that it can be used for authentication with services that the
client will access. For a service principal, "logging into
Kerberos" means obtaining the secret keys that the service needs to
decode incoming client authentication requests.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Steps to follow</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Examine the <a href="src/jaas-krb5.conf"><code>jaas-krb5.conf</code></a> configuration file.</p>
<p>This file contains two entries, one named <i>client</i> and one named
<i>server</i>. The client entry indicates that the
<code>LoginContext</code> must use the
<strong><code>com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule</code></strong>.
The server entry indicates that the <code>LoginContext</code> must use the
same login module, and use keys from the
<code>sample.keytab</code> file for the principal
<code>host/machineName</code>.</p></li>
<li>Determine the hostname of your machine by executing the
<code>hostname</code> command.</li>
<li><p>Edit this file and change the entry for server principal to use
the name of your machine. For example, if your machine name is
j1hol-001, this line in the configuration file should look like
this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
principal="host/j1hol-001"
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Perform client authentication by typing the following command:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
% java -Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas-krb5.conf Jaas client
</pre>
<p>You will be prompted for a password. You should
see the following output. Replace <i>password</i> with a password that is secure.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Kerberos password for test: password
Authenticated principal: [test@J1LABS.EXAMPLE.COM]
Performing secure action...
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Perform server authentication by typing the following command:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
% java -Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas-krb5.conf Jaas server
</pre>
<p>You should see the following output:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Authenticated principal: [host/j1hol-001@J1LABS.EXAMPLE.COM]
Performing secure action...
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you learned how to configure a JAAS
application to use a Kerberos login module, both as a client
principal who enters his/her username/password interactively, and
as a service principal who gets its keys from a keytab file.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>

establish secure communication channels using Java security
APIs.</p>
