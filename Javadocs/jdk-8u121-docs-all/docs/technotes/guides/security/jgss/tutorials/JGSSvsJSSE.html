<h1>When to use Java GSS-API vs. JSSE</h1>

<br />
<p>Java GSS-API and JSSE provide you with the same basic set of
security features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Client-server authentication</li>
<li>Encryption and integrity protection of transmitted data</li>
</ol>
<p>However, there are some key difference between the two. This
document lists some of them to help you decide which might be more
appropriate in your environment:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Kerberos Single Sign-On Support</b>
<p>In the Java 2 Standard Edition, GSS-API contains support for
Kerberos as a mandatory security mechanism. This means that if your
desktop has Kerberos support, you can write Java GSS-API based
applications that never prompt the user for a password.</p>
<p>At present JSSE does not support cipher suites to use
Kerberos-based authentication. Support for such a cipher suite is
dependent on its standarization in the TLS protocol at the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>
</li>
<li><b>Communications API</b>
<p>JSSE supports a socket-based API. JSSE sockets extend the socket
classes found in <code>java.net</code> and JSSE socket factories
extend the socket factories found in <code>javax.net</code>. Thus,
if your application is written such that its security needs to be
configured via a socket factory, then JSSE might be more
appropriate for you. JSSE sockets need to use some reliable
transport. Typically, implementations use TCP.</p>
<p>Java GSS-API, on the other hand, is a token-based API that
relies on the application to do the communication. This means that
the application can use TCP sockets, UDP datagrams, or any other
channel that will allow it to transport Java GSS-API generated
tokens. If your application has varying communication protocol
needs, then Java GSS-API might be more appropriate for you. Java
GSS-API can read and write its tokens using input and output
streams. However, you will need to set up the streams yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Credential Delegation</b>
<p>Java GSS-API allows the client to delegate its credentials to
the server when using Kerberos. If your application will be
deployed in a multi-tier environment where intermediaries need to
impersonate clients when talking to backend layers, Java GSS-API
might be more appropriate for you.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Selective Encryption</b>
<p>Because Java GSS-API is token-based, you can choose to
selectively encrypt certain messages but not all. If your
application needs to intersperse plaintext and ciphertext messages,
Java GSS-API might be more appropriate for you.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Protocol Requirements</b>
<p>JSSE provides an implementation of the TLS protocol defined in
RFC 2246. Java GSS-API provides an implementation of the GSS-API
framework defined in RFC 2853, as well as an implementation of the
Kerberos Version 5 mechanism defined in RFC 1964. (On Microsoft
Windows platforms, this may be known as SSPI with Kerberos.) Some
servers such as HTTPS servers will require you to use TLS, in which
case JSSE will be appropriate for you. Other servers such as LDAP
servers using SASL might need GSS-API with Kerberos, in which case
Java GSS-API will be appropriate for you.</p>
</li>
