<h1>Use of JAAS Login Utility and Java GSS-API for Secure Message
Exchanges</h1>

<br />
<br />
<p>This tutorial presents two sample applications to demonstrate
the use of the Java GSS-API. This API permits secure exchanges of
messages between communicating applications. Here are the sample
client and server applications you'll need for this tutorial:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="SampleClient.java"><code>SampleClient</code></a></li>
<li><a href="SampleServer.java"><code>SampleServer</code></a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<b>Note:</b> This tutorial uses the same client and server
applications as the <a href="BasicClientServer.html">Use of Java
GSS-API for Secure Message Exchanges Without JAAS Programming</a>
tutorial. In that tutorial, JAAS (Java Authentication and
Authorization Service) programming is not required. Instead, you
let the underlying mechanism decide how to get credentials.
<hr />
This tutorial uses policy files and a more complex login
configuration file. The programs are run with a security manager;
as a result, security-sensitive operations are not allowed unless
the required permissions were explicitly granted. This tutorial
also demonstrates how JAAS authorization adds <i>user-centric</i>
access control that applies control based on <i>who</i> is running
the code--not just on what code is running.

<h2>Before You Start: Recommended Reading</h2>
In this Java GSS-API tutorial, the first step is JAAS
authentication. Previous tutorials demonstrated the use of JAAS for
user authentication and authorization, and presented examples of
policy files and of login configuration files (specifying the
underlying authentication technology to be used) that JAAS
requires. Applications in the JAAS introductory tutorials, <a href=
"AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> and <a href=
"AcnAndAzn.html">JAAS Authorization</a>, made direct calls to JAAS
methods. The <a href="LoginSample.html">Use of JAAS Login
Utility</a> tutorial showed the use of a utility program that frees
the application from having to do this. The client and server
applications in the current tutorial also use the same utility
program, so we recommend you <b>read the login utility tutorial
first</b>.
<p>As with all tutorials in this series, the underlying technology
used to support authentication and secure communication for the
applications in this tutorial is Kerberos. See <a href=
"KerberosReq.html">Kerberos Requirements</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview of the Client and Server Applications</h2>
<p>The applications for this tutorial are named
<code>SampleClient</code> and <code>SampleServer</code>.</p>
<p>Each is invoked by executing the Login utility supplied with
this tutorial and passing it as arguments the name of the
application (<code>SampleClient</code> or
<code>SampleServer</code>), followed by the arguments needed by the
application. The Login utility uses a JAAS LoginContext to
authenticate the user using Kerberos. Finally, the Login utility
invokes the <code>main</code> method of the application class, in
our case either <code>SampleClient</code> or
<code>SampleServer</code>, and passes the application its
arguments.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of execution of the <code>SampleClient</code>
and <code>SampleServer</code> applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the <code>SampleServer</code> application by running the
Login utility and passing it as arguments the name
"<code>SampleServer</code>" followed by the arguments for the
<code>SampleServer</code> program. The Login utility prompts you
for the password for the principal that <code>SampleServer</code>
should run as. (See <a href="#KerbNames">Kerberos User and Service
Principal Names</a>.) After authentication is complete,
<code>SampleServer</code> is run it:
<ol>
<li>Reads its argument, the port number that it should listen on
for client connections.</li>
<li>Creates a ServerSocket for listening for client connections on
that port.</li>
<li>Listens for a connection.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Run the <code>SampleClient</code> application (possibly on a
different machine), by running the Login utility and passing it as
arguments the name "<code>SampleClient</code>" followed by the
arguments for the <code>SampleClient</code> program. The Login
utility prompts you for your Kerberos name and password. After
authentication is complete, <code>SampleClient</code> is run. It
<ol>
<li>Reads its arguments: (1) The name of the Kerberos principal
that represents <code>SampleServer</code>. (See <a href=
"#KerbNames">Kerberos User and Service Principal Names</a>.), (2)
the name of the host (machine) on which <code>SampleServer</code>
is running, and (3) the port number on which
<code>SampleServer</code> listens for client connections.</li>
<li>Attempts a socket connection with the
<code>SampleServer</code>, using the host and port it was passed as
arguments.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The socket connection is accepted by <code>SampleServer</code>
and both applications initialize a DataInputStream and a
DataOutputStream from the socket input and output streams, to be
used for future data exchanges.</li>
<li><code>SampleClient</code> and <code>SampleServer</code> each
instantiate a GSSContext and establish a shared context that will
enable subsequent secure data exchanges.</li>
<li><code>SampleClient</code> and <code>SampleServer</code> can now
securely exchange messages.</li>
<li>When <code>SampleClient</code> and <code>SampleServer</code>
are done exchanging messages, they perform clean-up
operations.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<b>Note:</b> Refer to "The <code>SampleClient</code> and
<code>SampleServer</code> Code" section of the <a href=
"BasicClientServer.html">Use of Java GSS-API for Secure Message
Exchanges Without JAAS Programming</a> tutorial for a full
discussion of the code used in this tutorial.

<a name="KerbNames" id="KerbNames"></a>
<h2>Kerberos User and Service Principal Names</h2>
<p>Since the underlying authentication and secure communication
technology used by this tutorial is Kerberos V5, we use
Kerberos-style <a href="glossary.html">principal</a> names wherever
a user or service is called for.</p>
<p>For example, when you run <code>SampleClient</code> you are
asked to provide your <b>user name</b>. Your Kerberos-style user
name is simply the user name you were assigned for Kerberos
authentication. It consists of a base user name (like "mjones")
followed by an "@" and your realm (like
"mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM").</p>
<p>A server program like <code>SampleServer</code> is typically
considered to offer a "service" and to be run on behalf of a
particular "<b>service principal</b>." A service principal name for
<code>SampleServer</code> is needed in several places:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you run <code>SampleServer</code> you must log in as the
appropriate service principal. The login configuration file for
this tutorial actually specifies the service principal name (as an
option to the Krb5LoginModule), so the JAAS authentication (done by
the Login utility) just asks you to specify the password for that
service principal. If you specify the correct password, the
authentication is successful, a Subject is created containing a
Principal with the service principal name, and that Subject is
associated with a new access control context. The
subsequently-executed code (the <code>SampleServer</code> code) is
considered to be executed on behalf of the specified
principal.</li>
<li>When you run <code>SampleClient</code>, one of the arguments is
the service principal name. This is needed so
<code>SampleClient</code> can initiate establishment of a security
context with the appropriate service.</li>
<li>The client and server policy files each require a
ServicePermission with name equal to the service principal name and
action equal to "initiate" or "accept" (for initiating or accepting
establishment of a security context).</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this document, and in the accompanying login
configuration file and policy files,</p>
<pre>
service_principal@your_realm
</pre>
is used as a placeholder to be replaced by the actual name to be
used in your environment. <i>Any</i> Kerberos principal can
actually be used for the service principal name. So <b>for the
purposes of trying out this tutorial, you could use your user name
as both the client user name and the service principal name.</b>
<p>In a production environment, system administrators typically
like servers to be run as specific principals only and may assign a
particular name to be used. Often the Kerberos-style service
principal name assigned is of the form</p>
<pre>
service_name/machine_name@realm; 
</pre>
<p>For example, an nfs service run on a machine named "raven" in
the realm named "KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM" could have the
service principal name</p>
<pre>
nfs/raven@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM
</pre>
<p>Such multi-component names are not required, however.
Single-component names, just like those of user principals, can be
used. For example, an installation might use the same ftp service
principal <code>ftp@realm</code> for all ftp servers in that realm,
while another installation might have different ftp principals for
different ftp servers, such as <code>ftp/host1@realm</code> and
<code>ftp/host2@realm</code> on machines <code>host1</code> and
<code>host2</code>, respectively.</p>
<h3>When the Realm is Required in Principal Names</h3>
<p>If the realm of a user or service principal name is the default
realm (see <a href="KerberosReq.html">Kerberos Requirements</a>),
you can leave off the realm when you are logging into Kerberos
(that is, when you are prompted for your username). Thus, for
example, if your user name is
"mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM", and you run
<code>SampleClient</code>, when it requests your user name you
could just specify "mjones", leaving off the realm. The name is
interpreted in the context of being a Kerberos principal name and
the default realm is appended, as needed.</p>
<p>You can also leave off the realm if a principal name will be
converted to a GSSName by a GSSManager <code>createName</code>
method. For example, when you run <code>SampleClient</code>, one of
the arguments is the server service principal name. You can specify
the name without including the realm, because
<code>SampleClient</code> passes the name to such a
<code>createName</code> method, which appends the default realm as
needed.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you always include realms when principal
names are used in login configuration files and policy files,
because the behavior of the parsers for such files may be
implementation-dependent; they may or may not append the default
realm before such names are utilized and subsequent actions may
fail if there is no realm in the name.</p>
<a name="TheLCF" id="TheLCF"></a>
<h2>The Login Configuration File</h2>
<p>Whenever JAAS is used, a login configuration is required to
specify the desired authentication technology. (See <a href=
"LoginConfigFile.html">JAAS Login Configuration File</a> for more
information about what a login configuration file is.) Both
<code>SampleClient</code> and <code>SampleServer</code> can use the
same login configuration file, if that file contains two entries,
one entry for the client side and one for the server side.</p>
<p>The <a href="csLogin.conf">csLogin.conf</a> login configuration
file used for this tutorial is the following:</p>
<pre>
<b>SampleClient</b> {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required;
};

<b>SampleServer</b> {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required storeKey=true 
    principal="service_principal@your_realm";
};
</pre>
<p>Note that the name for each entry matches the respective class
names for our two top-level applications, <code>SampleClient</code>
and <code>SampleServer</code>. Recall that this is also the name
that is passed to the Login utility that performs JAAS operations
for the application. That utility expects the name of the entry to
be looked up in your login configuration file to be the same as the
name it is passed.</p>
<p>Both entries specify that Sun's Kerberos V5 LoginModule must be
used to successfully authenticate the user. The Krb5LoginModule
succeeds only if the attempt to log in to the Kerberos KDC as a
specified entity is successful. In the case of
<code>SampleClient</code>, the user will be prompted for their name
and password. In the case of <code>SampleServer</code>, a name is
already supplied in this login configuration file (the specified
principal, as described below) and the user running
<code>SampleServer</code> is just asked for the password for the
entity specified by that name. They must specify the correct
password in order for authentication to succeed.</p>
<p>The <code>SampleServer</code> entry
<b><code>storeKey=true</code></b> indicates that a secret key
should be calculated from the password provided during login and it
should be stored in the private credentials of the Subject created
as a result of login. This key is subsequently utilized during
mutual authentication when establishing a security context between
<code>SampleClient</code> and <code>SampleServer</code>.</p>
<p>The Krb5LoginModule has a <b><code>principal</code></b> option
that can be used to specify that only the specified principal
(entity/user) should be logged in for the given program. Here, the
<code>SampleClient</code> entry does not specify a principal
(although it could, if desired), so the user is prompted for a user
name and password and anyone with a valid user name and password
can run <code>SampleClient</code>. <code>SampleServer</code>, on
the other hand, indicates a particular principal because system
administrators usually like servers to be run as specific
principals only. In this case, the user running
<code>SampleServer</code> is prompted for that principal's password
and must supply the correct one in order for authentication to
succeed.</p>
<p>Note that you must replace "service_principal@your_realm" with
the name of the service principal that represents
<code>SampleServer</code>. (See <a href="#KerbNames">Kerberos User
and Service Principal Names</a>.)</p>
<p>For information about all the possible options that can be
passed to Krb5LoginModule, see the <a href=
"../../../../../jre/api/security/jaas/spec/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html">
Krb5LoginModule documentation</a>.</p>
<a name="ThePFs" id="ThePFs"></a>
<h2>The Policy Files</h2>
<p>The policy file used when running <code>SampleClient</code> is
<a href="client.policy">client.policy</a>, and the policy file used
when running <code>SampleServer</code> is <a href=
"server.policy">server.policy</a>. Their contents are described
below.</p>
<h3>The Client Policy File</h3>
<p><a name="LoginPerms" id="LoginPerms"></a></p>
<h3>Permissions Required by the Login utility Classes</h3>
<p>A number of permissions are required by the classes in
<code>Login.java</code> (Login and MyAction). As recommended in the
<a href="LoginSample.html">previous tutorial</a> on the use of
Login, we create a <code>Login.jar</code> JAR file containing the
<code>Login.class</code> and <code>MyAction.class</code> files and
in the <code>client.policy</code> policy file we grant
<code>Login.jar AllPermission</code>:</p>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./Login.jar" {
   permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
</pre>
<h3>Permissions Required by <code>SampleClient</code></h3>
<p>The <code>SampleClient</code> code does two types of operations
for which permissions are required. It</p>
<ul>
<li>opens a socket connection with the host machine running the
<code>SampleServer</code> application.</li>
<li>initiates establishment of a security context with
<code>SampleServer</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The permission required to open a socket connection is</p>
<pre>
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*", "connect";
</pre>
<p>You may replace the "*" with the hostname or IP address of the
machine that <code>SampleServer</code> will be running on.</p>
<p>The permission(s) required to initiate establishment of a
security context will depend on the underlying mechanism. This
tutorial uses Kerberos as the underlying mechanism, and for that
two <code>javax.security.auth.kerberos.ServicePermission</code>s
are required. A ServicePermission contains a service principal name
and an action (or list of actions). To initiate establishment of a
security context, you need two ServicePermissions with action
"initiate", whose names specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>the service principal name for the ticket granting service for
your realm. Granting this permission essentially allows the use of
Kerberos as a client.</li>
<li>the service principal name representing
<code>SampleServer</code>. (See <a href="#KerbNames">Kerberos User
and Service Principal Names</a>.) Granting this permission allows
you to interact with the service, <code>SampleServer</code>, using
Kerberos.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to grant the permissions to a specific authenticated
user executing <code>SampleClient</code>, so we specify both the
<code>SampleClient</code> code location (in
<code>SampleClient.jar</code>) and a Principal designation
indicating the user name and realm for the user (you, the person
who will run <code>SampleClient</code>). (See <a href=
"AcnAndAzn.html#UserPFStmts">How Do You Make Principal-Based Policy
File Statements?</a> in the second tutorial of this series for
information on policy file <code>grant</code> statements that
include Principal designations.)</p>
<p>Here is the basic form for the <code>grant</code> statement:</p>
<pre>
  grant CodeBase "file:./SampleClient.jar", 
    Principal javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal 
        "your_user_name@your_realm" {

    permission java.net.SocketPermission "*", "connect";

    permission javax.security.auth.kerberos.ServicePermission
        "krbtgt/your_realm@your_realm", 
        "initiate";

    permission javax.security.auth.kerberos.ServicePermission
        "service_principal@your_realm", 
        "initiate";
};
</pre>
<p>You must substitute your Kerberos user name (complete with "@"
and realm) for "<code>your_user_name@your_realm</code>". For
example, if your user name is "mjones" and your realm is
"KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM", you would use
"mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM" (complete with the
quotes).</p>
<p>You must also substitute your realm in
"krbtgt/your_realm@your_realm" and <a href="#KerbNames">the service
principal name for the service principal representing the
server</a> for "<code>service_principal@your_realm</code>". Suppose
the former is
"krbtgt/KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM"
and the latter is
"sample/raven.example.com@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM", and your
user name is as specified in the previous paragraph. Then the
<code>grant</code> statement would be</p>
<pre>
grant CodeBase "file:./SampleClient.jar", 
    Principal javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal 
        "mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM" {

    permission java.net.SocketPermission "*", "connect";

    permission javax.security.auth.kerberos.ServicePermission
        "krbtgt/KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM", 
        "initiate";

    permission javax.security.auth.kerberos.ServicePermission
        "sample/raven.example.com@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM", 
        "initiate";
};
</pre>
<h3>The Server Policy File</h3>
<h3>Permissions Required by the Login Utility Classes</h3>
<p>The <code>grant</code> statement in the server policy file for
the Login classes is exactly the same as the one in the client
policy file, as described in <a href="#LoginPerms">Permissions
Required by the Login Utility Classes</a>:</p>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./Login.jar" {
   permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
</pre>
<h3>Permissions Required by <code>SampleServer</code></h3>
<p>The <code>SampleServer</code> code does two types of operations
for which permissions are required. It</p>
<ul>
<li>accepts socket connections.</li>
<li>accepts establishment of a security context, that is, it is the
"acceptor" for security context establishment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The permission required to accept socket connections is</p>
<pre>
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*", "accept";
</pre>
<p>You may replace the "*" with the hostname or IP address of the
machine that <code>SampleClient</code> will be running on.</p>
<p>The permission required to accept establishment of a security
context is</p>
<pre>
permission javax.security.auth.kerberos.ServicePermission
    "service_principal@your_realm", 
    "accept";
</pre>
where "service_principal@your_realm" is <a href="#KerbNames">the
Kerberos name of the service principal that represents
<code>SampleServer</code></a>.
<p>We want to grant the permissions to a specific authenticated
user executing <code>SampleServer</code> (the service principal
considered to represent <code>SampleServer</code>), so we specify
both the <code>SampleServer</code> code location (in
<code>SampleServer.jar</code>) and a Principal designation
indicating the service principal. Suppose this name is
"sample/raven.example.com@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM". Then the
<code>grant</code> statement would be</p>
<pre>
  grant CodeBase "file:./SampleServer.jar" 
    Principal javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal 
        "sample/raven.example.com@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM" {

    permission java.net.SocketPermission "*", "accept";

    permission javax.security.auth.kerberos.ServicePermission
        "sample/raven.example.com@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM", "accept";
};
</pre>
<a name="RunProgs" id="RunProgs"></a>
<h2>Running the <code>SampleClient</code> and
<code>SampleServer</code> Programs</h2>
<p>To execute the <code>SampleClient</code> and
<code>SampleServer</code> programs, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#PrepSS">Prepare <code>SampleServer</code> for
Execution</a></li>
<li><a href="#PrepSC">Prepare <code>SampleClient</code> for
Execution</a></li>
<li><a href="#ExecSS">Execute <code>SampleServer</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#ExecSC">Execute <code>SampleClient</code></a></li>
</ul>
<a name="PrepSS" id="PrepSS"></a>
<h3>Prepare <code>SampleServer</code> for Execution</h3>
<p>To prepare <code>SampleServer</code> for execution, do the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the following files into a directory accessible by the
machine on which you will run <code>SampleServer</code>:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Login.java">Login.java</a> source file.</li>
<li>The <a href="SampleServer.java">SampleServer.java</a> source
file.</li>
<li>The <a href="csLogin.conf">csLogin.conf</a> login configuration
file.</li>
<li>The <a href="server.policy">server.policy</a> policy file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replace "service_principal@your_realm" in
<code>csLogin.conf</code> with <a href="#KerbNames">the name of the
service principal representing <code>SampleServer</code></a>.</li>
<li>In both places it appears, replace
"service_principal@your_realm" in <code>server.policy</code> with
the Kerberos name of the service principal that represents
<code>SampleServer</code>. (The same name as that used in the login
configuration file.)</li>
<li>Compile <code>Login.java</code> and
<code>SampleServer.java</code>:
<pre>
javac Login.java SampleServer.java
</pre>
<p>Note that <code>Login.java</code> contains two classes and thus
compiling <code>Login.java</code> creates <code>Login.class</code>
and <code>MyAction.class</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>Create a JAR file named <code>Login.jar</code> containing
<code>Login.class and MyAction.class</code>:
<pre>
jar -cvf Login.jar Login.class MyAction.class
</pre></li>
<li>Create a JAR file named <code>SampleServer.jar</code>
containing <code>SampleServer.class</code>:
<pre>
jar -cvf SampleServer.jar SampleServer.class
</pre></li>
</ol>
<a name="PrepSC" id="PrepSC"></a>
<h3>Prepare <code>SampleClient</code> for Execution</h3>
<p>To prepare <code>SampleClient</code> for execution, do the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the following files into a directory accessible by the
machine on which you will run <code>SampleClient</code>:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Login.java">Login.java</a> source file.</li>
<li>The <a href="SampleClient.java">SampleClient.java</a> source
file.</li>
<li>The <a href="csLogin.conf">csLogin.conf</a> login configuration
file.</li>
<li>The <a href="client.policy">client.policy</a> policy file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replace parts of <code>client.policy</code>:
<ul>
<li>replace "your_user_name@your_realm" with your user name and
realm.</li>
<li>replace <code>your_realm</code> in
"krbtgt/your_realm@your_realm" with your realm.</li>
<li>replace "service_principal@your_realm" with <a href=
"#KerbNames">the Kerberos name of the service principal that
represents <code>SampleServer</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compile <code>Login.java</code> and
<code>SampleClient.java</code>:
<pre>
javac Login.java SampleClient.java
</pre></li>
<li>Create a JAR file named <code>Login.jar</code> containing
<code>Login.class and MyAction.class</code>:
<pre>
jar -cvf Login.jar Login.class MyAction.class
</pre></li>
<li>Create a JAR file named <code>SampleClient.jar</code>
containing <code>SampleClient.class</code>:
<pre>
jar -cvf SampleClient.jar SampleClient.class
</pre></li>
</ol>
<a name="ExecSS" id="ExecSS"></a>
<h3>Execute <code>SampleServer</code></h3>
<p>It is important to execute <code>SampleServer</code> before
<code>SampleClient</code> because <code>SampleClient</code> will
try to make a socket connection to <code>SampleServer</code> and
that will fail if <code>SampleServer</code> is not yet running and
accepting socket connections.</p>
<p>To execute <code>SampleServer</code>, be sure to run it on the
machine it is expected to be run on. This machine name (host name)
is specified as an argument to <code>SampleClient</code>. The
service principal name appears in several places, including the
login configuration file and the policy files.</p>
<p>Go to the directory in which you have prepared
<code>SampleServer</code> for execution. Execute the
<code>Login</code> class, specifying</p>
<ul>
<li>by an appropriate <code>-classpath</code> clause that classes
should be searched for in the <code>Login.jar</code> and
<code>SampleServer.jar</code> JAR files,</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.manager</code> that a security manager
should be installed,</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt;</code>
that your Kerberos realm is the one specified. For example, if your
realm is "KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM" you'd put
<code>-Djava.security.krb5.realm=KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM</code>.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> that
your Kerberos KDC is the one specified. For example, if your KDC is
"samplekdc.example.com" you'd put
<code>-Djava.security.krb5.kdc=samplekdc.example.com</code>.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.policy=server.policy</code> that the
policy file to be used is <code>server.policy</code>, and</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=csLogin.conf</code>
that the login configuration file to be used is
<code>csLogin.conf</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You pass the name of your application (in this case,
"<code>SampleServer</code>") as an argument to Login. You then add
as arguments any arguments required by your application, which in
the case of <code>SampleServer</code> is a single argument
specifying the port number to be used for listening for client
connections. Choose a high port number unlikely to be used for
anything else. An example would be something like 4444.</p>
<p>Below are the full commands to use for both Microsoft Windows
and Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems.
The only difference is that on Microsoft Windows
systems you use semicolons to separate classpath items, while you
use colons for that purpose on Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems.</p>
<p><b>Important: In these commands, you must replace
<code>&lt;port_number&gt;</code> with an appropriate port number,
<code>&lt;your_realm&gt;</code> with your Kerberos realm, and
<code>&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> with your Kerberos KDC.</b></p>
<p>Here is the command for Microsoft Windows systems:</p>
<pre>
java -classpath Login.jar;SampleServer.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djava.security.policy=server.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=csLogin.conf 
 Login SampleServer &lt;port_number&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here is the command for Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems:</p>
<pre>
java -classpath Login.jar:SampleServer.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djava.security.policy=server.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=csLogin.conf 
 Login SampleServer &lt;port_number&gt;
</pre>
<p>Type the full command on one line. Multiple lines are used here
for legibility. If the command is too long for your system, you may
need to place it in a .bat file (for Microsoft Windows) or a .sh
file (for Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X) and then run that file
to execute the command.</p>
<p>You will be prompted for the Kerberos password for the service
principal. The underlying Kerberos authentication mechanism
specified in the login configuration file will log the service
principal into Kerberos. Once authentication is successfully
completed, the <code>SampleServer</code> code will be executed on
behalf of the service principal. It will listen for socket
connections on the specified port.</p>

<h3>Execute <code>SampleClient</code></h3>
<p>To execute <code>SampleClient</code>, go to the directory in
which you have prepared <code>SampleClient</code> for execution.
Then execute the <code>Login</code> class, specifying</p>
<ul>
<li>by an appropriate <code>-classpath</code> clause that classes
should be searched for in the <code>Login.jar</code> and
<code>SampleClient.jar</code> JAR files,</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.manager</code> that a security manager
should be installed,</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt;</code>
that your Kerberos realm is the one specified.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> that
your Kerberos KDC is the one specified.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.policy=client.policy</code> that the
policy file to be used is <code>client.policy</code>, and</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=csLogin.conf</code>
that the login configuration file to be used is
<code>csLogin.conf</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pass to Login the name of your application
("<code>SampleClient</code>") followed by the arguments required by
<code>SampleClient</code>. The <code>SampleClient</code> arguments
are (1) <a href="#KerbNames">the Kerberos name of the service
principal that represents <code>SampleServer</code></a>, (2) the
name of the host (machine) on which <code>SampleServer</code> is
running, and (3) the port number on which <code>SampleServer</code>
is listening for client connections.</p>
<p>Below are the full commands to use for both Microsoft Windows
and Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems.</p>
<p><b>Important: In these commands, you must replace
<code>&lt;service_principal&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;host&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;port_number&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;your_realm&gt;</code>,
and <code>&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> with appropriate values</b> (and
note that the port number must be the same as the port number
passed as an argument to <code>SampleServer</code>). These values
need not be placed in quotes.</p>
<p>Here is the command for Microsoft Windows systems:</p>
<pre>
java -classpath Login.jar;SampleClient.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djava.security.policy=client.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=csLogin.conf 
 Login SampleClient &lt;service_principal&gt; &lt;host&gt; &lt;port_number&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here is the command for Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems:</p>
<pre>
java -classpath Login.jar:SampleClient.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djava.security.policy=client.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=csLogin.conf 
 Login SampleClient &lt;service_principal&gt; &lt;host&gt; &lt;port_number&gt;
</pre>
<p>Type the full command on one line. Multiple lines are used here
for legibility. As with the command for executing
<code>SampleServer</code>, if the command is too long to type
directly into your command window, place it in a .bat file
(Microsoft Windows) or a .sh file (Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X)
and then execute that
file.</p>
<p>When prompted, type your Kerberos user name and password. The
underlying Kerberos authentication mechanism specified in the login
configuration file will log you into Kerberos. Once authentication
is successfully completed, the <code>SampleClient</code> code will
be executed on behalf of you. It will request a socket connection
with <code>SampleServer</code>. Once <code>SampleServer</code>
accepts the connection, <code>SampleClient</code> and
<code>SampleServer</code> establish a shared context and then
exchange messages as described in this tutorial.</p>
