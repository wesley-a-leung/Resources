<h1>Use of Java GSS-API for Secure Message Exchanges Without JAAS
Programming</h1>

<p>This tutorial presents two sample applications demonstrating the
use of the Java GSS-API for secure exchanges of messages between
communicating applications, in this case a client application and a
server application.</p>

<p>Java GSS-API uses what is called a "security mechanism" to
provide these services. The GSS-API implementation contains support for the
Kerberos V5 mechanism in addition to any other vendor-specific
choices. The Kerberos V5 mechanism is used for this tutorial.</p>

<p>In order to perform authentication between the client and server
and to establish cryptographic keys for secure communication, a
GSS-API mechanism needs access to certain credentials for the local
entity on each side of the connection. In our case, the credential
used on the client side consists of a Kerberos ticket, and on the
server side, it consists of a long-term Kerberos secret key.
Kerberos tickets can optionally include the host address and IPv4
and IPv6 host addresses are both supported. Java GSS-API requires
that the mechanism obtain these credentials from the Subject
associated with the thread's access control context.</p>

<p>To populate a Subject with such credentials, client and server
applications typically will first perform JAAS authentication using
a Kerberos module. The <a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS
Authentication</a> tutorial demonstrates how to do this. The
<a href="AcnAndAzn.html">JAAS Authorization</a> tutorial then
demonstrates how to associate the authenticated Subject with the
thread's access control context. A utility has also been written as
a convenience to automatically perform those operations on your
behalf. The <a href="LoginSample.html">Use of JAAS Login
Utility</a> tutorial demonstrates how to use the Login utility.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, we will not have the client and server
perform JAAS authentication, nor will we have them use the Login
utility. Instead, we will rely on setting the system property
<code>javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly</code> to
<code>false</code>, which allows us to relax the restriction of
requiring a GSS mechanism to obtain necessary credentials from an
existing <a href="glossary.html">Subject</a>, set up by JAAS. See
<a href="#useSub">The useSubjectCredsOnly System Property</a>.</p>
<p>Note: This is a simplified introductory tutorial. For example,
we do not include any policy files or run the sample code using a
security manager. In real life, code using Java GSS-API should be
run with a security manager, so that security-sensitive operations
would not be allowed unless the required permissions were
explicitly granted.</p>
<p>There is another tutorial, <a href="ClientServer.html">Use of
JAAS Login Utility and Java GSS-API for Secure Message
Exchanges</a>, that is just like the tutorial you are reading
except that it utilizes the Login utility, policy files, and a more
complex login configuration file (A <a href=
"LoginConfigFile.html">login configuration file</a>, required
whenever JAAS authentication is done, specifies the desired
authentication module).</p>
<p>As with all tutorials in this series, the underlying technology
used to support authentication and secure communication for the
applications in this tutorial is Kerberos V5. See <a href=
"KerberosReq.html">Kerberos Requirements</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview of the Client And Server Applications</h2>
<p>The applications for this tutorial are named SampleClient and
SampleServer.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of execution of the SampleClient and
SampleServer applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the SampleServer application. SampleServer
<ol>
<li>Reads its argument, the port number that it should listen on
for client connections.</li>
<li>Creates a ServerSocket for listening for client connections on
that port.</li>
<li>Listens for a connection.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Run the SampleClient application (possibly on a different
machine). SampleClient
<ol>
<li>Reads its arguments: (1) The name of the Kerberos principal
that represents SampleServer. (See <a href="#KerbNames">Kerberos
User and Service Principal Names</a>.), (2) the name of the host
(machine) on which SampleServer is running, and (3) the port number
on which SampleServer listens for client connections.</li>
<li>Attempts a socket connection with the SampleServer, using the
host and port it was passed as arguments.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The socket connection is accepted by SampleServer and both
applications initialize a DataInputStream and a DataOutputStream
from the socket input and output streams, to be used for future
data exchanges.</li>
<li>SampleClient and SampleServer each instantiate a GSSContext and
follow a protocol for establishing a shared context that will
enable subsequent secure data exchanges.</li>
<li>SampleClient and SampleServer can now securely exchange
messages.</li>
<li>When SampleClient and SampleServer are done exchanging
messages, they perform clean-up operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The actual code and further details are presented in the
following sections.</p>
<a name="Progs" id="Progs"></a>
<h2>The SampleClient and SampleServer Code</h2>
<p>The entire code for both the <a href=
"SampleClient.java">SampleClient</a> and <a href=
"SampleServer.java">SampleServer</a> programs resides in their
<code>main</code> methods and can be broken down into the following
subparts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#GetArgs">Obtain the Command-Line Arguments</a></li>
<li><a href="#SocketConn">Establish a Socket Connection for
Transfers Between SampleClient and SampleServer</a></li>
<li><a href="#EstContext">Establish a Security Context</a></li>
<li><a href="#ExchangeMsgs">Securely Exchange Messages</a></li>
<li><a href="#Cleanup">Clean Up</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: The Java GSS-API classes utilized by these programs
(GSSManager, GSSContext, GSSName, GSSCredential, MessageProp, and
Oid) are found in the <code>org.ietf.jgss</code> package. <a name=
"GetArgs" id="GetArgs"></a></p>
<h3>Obtaining the Command-Line Arguments</h3>
<p>The first thing both our client and server <code>main</code>
methods do is read the command-line arguments.</p>
<h4>Arguments Read By SampleClient</h4>
<p>SampleClient expects three arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>A service principal name -- The name of the Kerberos principal
that represents SampleServer. (See <a href="#KerbNames">Kerberos
User and Service Principal Names</a>.)</li>
<li>A host name -- The machine on which SampleServer is
running.</li>
<li>A port number -- The port number of the port on which
SampleServer listens for connections.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the code for reading the command-line arguments:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">if (args.length &lt; 3) {
    System.out.println("Usage: java &lt;options&gt; Login SampleClient "
       + " &lt;servicePrincipal&gt; &lt;hostName&gt; &lt;port&gt;");
    System.exit(-1);
}

String server = args[0];
String hostName = args[1];
int port = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);</pre>
<h4>Argument Read By SampleServer</h4>
<p>SampleServer expects just one argument:</p>
<ul>
<li>A local port number -- The port number used by SampleServer for
listening for connections with clients. This number should be the
same as the port number specified when running the SampleClient
program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the code for reading the command-line argument:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">if (args.length != 1) {
    System.out.println(
        "Usage: java &lt;options&gt; Login SampleServer &lt;localPort&gt;");
    System.exit(-1);
}

int localPort = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);</pre>
<a name="SocketConn" id="SocketConn"></a>
<h3>Establishing a Socket Connection for Message Exchanges</h3>
<p>Java GSS-API provides methods for creating and interpreting
tokens (opaque byte data). The tokens contain messages to be
securely exchanged between two peers, but the method of actual
token transfer is up to the peers. For our SampleClient and
SampleServer applications, we establish a socket connection between
the client and server and exchange data using the socket input and
output streams.</p>
<h4>SampleClient Code For Socket Connection</h4>
<p>SampleClient was passed as arguments the name of the host
machine SampleServer is running on, as well as the port number on
which SampleServer will be listening for connections, so
SampleClient has all it needs to establish a socket connection with
SampleServer. It uses the following code to set up the connection
and initialize a DataInputStream and a DataOutputStream for future
data exchanges:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">Socket socket = new Socket(hostName, port);

DataInputStream inStream = 
  new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
DataOutputStream outStream = 
  new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());

System.out.println("Connected to server " 
   + socket.getInetAddress());</pre>
<h4>SampleServer Code For Socket Connection</h4>
<p>The SampleServer application was passed as an argument the port
number to be used for listening for connections from clients. It
creates a ServerSocket for listening on that port:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(localPort);</pre>
<p>The ServerSocket can then wait for and accept a connection from
a client, and then initialize a DataInputStream and a
DataOutputStream for future data exchanges with the client :</p>
<pre class="codeblock">Socket socket = ss.accept();

DataInputStream inStream =
    new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
DataOutputStream outStream = 
    new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());

System.out.println("Got connection from client "
    + socket.getInetAddress());</pre>
<p>The <code>accept</code> method waits until a client (in our
case, SampleClient) requests a connection on the host and port of
the SampleServer, which SampleClient does via</p>
<pre class="codeblock">Socket socket = new Socket(hostName, port);</pre>
<p>When the connection is requested and established, the
<code>accept</code> method returns a new Socket object bound to a
new port. The server can communicate with the client over this new
socket and continue to listen for other client connection requests
on the ServerSocket bound to the original port. Thus, a server
program typically has a loop which can handle multiple connection
requests.</p>
<p>The basic loop structure for our SampleServer is the
following:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">while (true) {

    Socket socket = ss.accept();

    <em>&lt;Establish input and output streams for the connection&gt;</em>; 
    <em>&lt;Establish a context with the client&gt;</em>; 
    <em>&lt;Exchange messages with the client&gt;</em>;
    <em>&lt;Clean up&gt;</em>;
}</pre>
<p>Client connections are queued at the original port, so with this
program structure used by SampleServer, the interaction with the
first client making a connection has to complete before the next
connection can be accepted. The server could actually service
multiple clients simultaneously through the use of threads - one
thread per client connection, as in</p>
<pre class="codeblock">while (true) {
    <em>&lt;accept a connection&gt;</em>;
    <em>&lt;create a thread to handle the client&gt;</em>;
}
</pre>
<a name="EstContext" id="EstContext"></a>
<h3>Establishing a Security Context</h3>
<p>Before two applications can use Java GSS-API to securely
exchange messages between them, they must establish a joint
security context using their credentials. (Note: In the case of
SampleClient, the credentials were established when the Login
utility authenticated the user on whose behalf the SampleClient was
run, and similarly for SampleServer.) The security context
encapsulates shared state information that might include, for
example, cryptographic keys. One use of such keys might be to
encrypt messages to be exchanged, if encryption is requested.</p>
<p>As part of the security context establishment, the context
initiator (in our case, SampleClient) is authenticated to the
acceptor (SampleServer), and may require that the acceptor also be
authenticated back to the initiator, in which case we say that
"mutual authentication" took place.</p>
<p>Both applications create and use a <b>GSSContext</b> object to
establish and maintain the shared information that makes up the
security context.</p>
<p>The instantiation of the context object is done differently by
the context initiator and the context acceptor. After the initiator
instantiates a GSSContext, it may choose to set various context
options that will determine the characteristics of the desired
security context, for example, specifying whether or not mutual
authentication should take place. After all the desired
characteristics have been set, the initiator calls the
<code>initSecContext</code> method, which produces a token required
by the acceptor's <code>acceptSecContext</code> method.</p>
<p>While Java GSS-API methods exist for preparing tokens to be
exchanged between applications, <i>it is the responsibility of the
applications to actually transfer the tokens between them.</i> So
after the initiator has received a token from its call to
<code>initSecContext</code>, it sends that token to the acceptor.
The acceptor calls <code>acceptSecContext</code>, passing it the
token. The <code>acceptSecContext</code> method may in turn return
a token. If it does, the acceptor should send that token to the
initiator, which should then call <code>initSecContext</code> again
and pass it this token. Each time <code>initSecContext</code> or
<code>acceptSecContext</code> returns a token, the application that
called the method should send the token to its peer and that peer
should pass the token to its appropriate method
(<code>acceptSecContext</code> or <code>initSecContext</code>).
This continues until the context is fully established (which is the
case when the context's <code>isEstablished</code> method returns
<code>true</code>).</p>
<p>The context establishment code for our sample applications is
described in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#SCFullContextEst">Context Establishment by
SampleClient</a></li>
<li><a href="#SSFullContextEst">Context Establishment by
SampleServer</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="SCFullContextEst" id="SCFullContextEst"></a>
<h3>Context Establishment by SampleClient</h3>
<p>In our client/server scenario, SampleClient is the context
initiator. Here are the basic steps it takes to establish a
security context. It</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#SCContextInst">Instantiates a GSSContext.</a></li>
<li><a href="#SCSetOptions">Sets the desired optional features on
the context.</a></li>
<li><a href="#SCContextEstLoop">Loops</a> while the context is not
yet established, each time calling <code>initSecContext</code>,
sending any returned token to SampleServer, and receiving a token
(if any) from SampleServer.</li>
</ol>
<a name="SCContextInst" id="SCContextInst"></a>
<h3>SampleClient GSSContext Instantiation</h3>
<p>A <b>GSSContext</b> is created by instantiating a
<b>GSSManager</b> and then calling one of its
<code>createContext</code> methods. The GSSManager class serves as
a factory for other important GSS API classes. It can create
instances of classes implementing the GSSContext, GSSCredential,
and GSSName interfaces.</p>
<p>SampleClient obtains an instance of the default GSSManager
subclass by calling the GSSManager static method
<code>getInstance</code>:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();</pre>
<p>The default GSSManager subclass is one whose
<code>create*</code> methods (<code>createContext</code>, etc.)
return classes whose implementations support Kerberos as the
underlying technology.</p>
<p>The GSSManager factory method for creating a context on the
initiator's side has the following signature:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">GSSContext createContext(GSSName peer, Oid mech, 
            GSSCredential myCred, int lifetime);</pre>
<p>The arguments are described below, followed by the complete call
to <code>createContext</code>.</p>
<h4>The <code>GSSName peer</code> Argument</h4>
<p>The peer in our client/server paradigm is the server. For the
<code>peer</code> argument, we need a <b>GSSName</b> for the
service principal representing the server. (See <a href=
"#KerbNames">Kerberos User and Service Principal Names</a>.) A
String for the service principal name is passed as the first
argument to SampleClient, which places the argument into its local
String variable named <code>server</code>. The GSSManager
<code>manager</code> is used to instantiate a GSSName by calling
one of its <code>createName</code> methods. SampleClient calls the
<code>createName</code> method with the following signature:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">GSSName createName(String nameStr, Oid nameType);</pre>

<p>SampleClient passes the <code>server</code> String for the
<code>nameStr</code> argument.</p>
<p>The second argument is an <b>Oid</b>. An Oid represents a
Universal Object Identifier. Oids are hierarchically
globally-interpretable identifiers used within the GSS-API
framework to identify mechanisms and name types. The structure and
encoding of Oids is defined in the ISOIEC-8824 and ISOIEC-8825
standards. The Oid passed to the <code>createName</code> method is
specifically a name type Oid (not a mechanism Oid).</p>
<p>In GSS-API, string names are often mapped from a
mechanism-independent format into a mechanism-specific format.
Usually, an Oid specifies what name format the string is in so that
the mechanism knows how to do this mapping. Passing in a
<code>null</code> Oid indicates that the name is already in a
native format that the mechanism uses. This is the case for the
<code>server</code> String; it is in the appropriate format for a
Kerberos Version 5 name. Thus, SampleClient passes a
<code>null</code> for the Oid. Here is the call:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">GSSName serverName = manager.createName(server, null);</pre>

<h4>The <code>Oid mech</code> Argument</h4>

<p>The second argument to the GSSManager <code>createContext</code>
method is an Oid representing the mechanism to be used for the
authentication between the client and the server during context
establishment and for subsequent secure communication between
them.</p>
<p>Our tutorial will use Kerberos V5 as the security mechanism. The
Oid for the Kerberos V5 mechanism is defined in <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1964.txt">RFC 1964</a> as
"1.2.840.113554.1.2.2" so we create such an Oid:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">Oid krb5Oid = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2");</pre>

<p>SampleClient passes <code>krb5Oid</code> as the second argument
to <code>createContext</code>.</p>

<h4>The <code>GSSCredential myCred</code> Argument</h4>
<p>The third argument to the GSSManager <code>createContext</code>
method is a <b>GSSCredential</b> representing the caller's
credentials. If you pass <code>null</code> for this argument, as
SampleClient does, the default credentials are used.</p>
<h4>The <code>int lifetime</code> Argument</h4>
<p>The final argument to the GSSManager <code>createContext</code>
method is an <code>int</code> specifying the desired lifetime, in
seconds, for the context that is created. SampleClient passes
<code>GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME</code> to request a default
lifetime.</p>
<h4>The Complete createContext Call</h4>
<p>Now that we have all the required arguments, here is the call
SampleClient makes to create a GSSContext:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">GSSContext context = 
    manager.createContext(serverName,
                          krb5Oid,
                          null,
                          GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME);</pre>
<a name="SCSetOptions" id="SCSetOptions"></a>

<h4>SampleClient Setting of Desired Options</h4>

<p>After instantiating a context, and prior to actually
establishing the context with the context acceptor, the context
initiator may choose to set various options that determine the
desired security context characteristics. Each such option is set
by calling a <code>request</code> method on the instantiated
context. Most <code>request</code> methods take a
<code>boolean</code> argument for indicating whether or not the
feature is requested. It is not always possible for a request to be
satisfied, so whether or not it was can be determined after context
establishment by calling one of the <code>get</code> methods.</p>
<p>SampleClient requests the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Mutual authentication</b>. The context initiator is always
authenticated to the acceptor. If the initiator requests mutual
authentication, then the acceptor is also authenticated to the
initiator.</li>
<li><b>Confidentiality</b>. Requesting confidentiality means that
you request the <i>enabling</i> of encryption for the context
method named <code>wrap</code>. Encryption is actually used only if
the MessageProp object passed to the <code>wrap</code> method
requests privacy.</li>
<li><b>Integrity</b>. This requests integrity for the
<code>wrap</code> and <code>getMIC</code> methods. When integrity
is requested, a cryptographic tag known as a Message Integrity Code
(MIC) will be generated when calling those methods. When
<code>getMIC</code> is called, the generated MIC appears in the
returned token. When <code>wrap</code> is called, the MIC is
packaged together with the message (the original message or the
result of encrypting the message, depending on whether
confidentiality was applied) all as part of one token. You can
subsequently verify the MIC against the message to ensure that the
message has not been modified in transit.</li>
</ol>
<p>The SampleClient code for making these requests on the
GSSException <code>context</code> is the following:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">context.requestMutualAuth(true);  // Mutual authentication
context.requestConf(true);  // Will use encryption later
context.requestInteg(true); // Will use integrity later</pre>

<p>Note: When using the default GSSManager implementation and the
Kerberos mechanism, these requests will always be granted.</p>
<a name="SCContextEstLoop" id="SCContextEstLoop"></a>

<h3>SampleClient Context Establishment Loop</h3>

<p>After SampleClient has instantiated a GSSContext and specified
the desired context options, it can actually establish the security
context with SampleServer. To do so, SampleClient has a loop. Each
loop iteration</p>
<ol>
<li>Calls the context's <code>initSecContext</code> method. If this
is the first call, the method is passed a <code>null</code> token.
Otherwise, it is passed the token most recently sent to
SampleClient by SampleServer (a token generated by a SampleServer
call to <code>acceptSecContext</code>).</li>
<li>Sends the token returned by <code>initSecContext</code> (if
any) to SampleServer. The first call to <code>initSecContext</code>
always produces a token. The last call might not return a
token.</li>
<li>Checks to see if the context is established. If not,
SampleClient receives another token from SampleServer and then
starts the next loop iteration.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tokens returned by <code>initSecContext</code> or received
from SampleServer are placed in a byte array. Tokens should be
treated by SampleClient and SampleServer as opaque data to be
passed between them and interpreted by Java GSS-API methods.</p>
<p>The <code>initSecContext</code> arguments are a byte array
containing a token, the starting offset into that array of where
the token begins, and the token length. For the first call,
SampleClient passes a null token, since no token has yet been
received from SampleServer.</p>
<p>To exchange tokens with SampleServer, SampleClient uses the
DataInputStream <code>inStream</code> and DataOutputStream
<code>outStream</code> it previously set up using the input and
output streams for the socket connection made with SampleServer.
Note that whenever a token is written, the number of bytes in the
token is written first, followed by the token itself. The reasons
are discussed in the introduction to the <a href=
"#SCandSSMsgExchanges">The SampleClient and SampleServer Message
Exchanges</a> section.</p>
<p>Here is the SampleClient context establishment loop, followed by
code displaying information about who the client and server are and
whether or not mutual authentication actually took place:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">byte[] token = new byte[0];

while (!context.isEstablished()) {

    // token is ignored on the first call
    token = context.<b>initSecContext</b>(token, 0, token.length);

    // Send a token to the server if one was generated by
    // initSecContext
    if (token != null) {
        System.out.println("Will send token of size "
                   + token.length + " from initSecContext.");
        outStream.writeInt(token.length);
        outStream.write(token);
        outStream.flush();
    }

    // If the client is done with context establishment
    // then there will be no more tokens to read in this loop
    if (!context.isEstablished()) {
        token = new byte[inStream.readInt()];
        System.out.println("Will read input token of size "
                   + token.length
                   + " for processing by initSecContext");
        inStream.readFully(token);
    }
}

System.out.println("Context Established! ");
System.out.println("Client is " + context.getSrcName());
System.out.println("Server is " + context.getTargName());
if (context.getMutualAuthState())
    System.out.println("Mutual authentication took place!");</pre>
    
<a name="SSFullContextEst" id="SSFullContextEst"></a>

<h3>Context Establishment by SampleServer</h3>
<p>In our client/server scenario, SampleServer is the context
acceptor. Here are the basic steps it takes to establish a security
context. It</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#SSContextInst">Instantiates a GSSContext.</a></li>
<li><a href="#SSContextEstLoop">Loops</a> while the context is not
yet established, each time receiving a token from SampleClient,
calling <code>acceptSecContext</code> and passing it the token, and
sending any returned token to SampleClient.</li>
</ol>
<a name="SSContextInst" id="SSContextInst"></a>
<h3>SampleServer GSSContext Instantiation</h3>
<p>As described in <a href="#SCContextInst">SampleClient GSSContext
Instantiation</a>, a GSSContext is created by instantiating a
GSSManager and then calling one of its <code>createContext</code>
methods.</p>
<p>Like SampleClient, SampleServer obtains an instance of the
default GSSManager subclass by calling the GSSManager static method
<code>getInstance</code>:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();</pre>

<p>The GSSManager factory method for creating a context on the
acceptor's side has the following signature:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">GSSContext createContext(GSSCredential myCred);</pre>

<p>If you pass <code>null</code> for the GSSCredential argument, as
SampleServer does, the default credentials are used. The context is
instantiated via the following:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">GSSContext context = manager.createContext((GSSCredential)null);</pre>

<a name="SSContextEstLoop" id="SSContextEstLoop"></a>
<h3>SampleServer Context Establishment Loop</h3>
<p>After SampleServer has instantiated a GSSContext, it can
establish the security context with SampleClient. To do so,
SampleServer has a loop that continues until the context is
established. Each loop iteration does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receives a token from SampleClient. This token is the result of
a SampleClient <code>initSecContext</code> call.</li>
<li>Calls the context's <code>acceptSecContext</code> method,
passing it the token just received.</li>
<li>If <code>acceptSecContext</code> returns a token, then
SampleServer sends this token to SampleClient and then starts the
next loop iteration if the context is not yet established.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tokens returned by <code>acceptSecContext</code> or received
from SampleClient are placed in a byte array.</p>
<p>The <code>acceptSecContext</code> arguments are a byte array
containing a token, the starting offset into that array of where
the token begins, and the token length.</p>
<p>To exchange tokens with SampleClient, SampleServer uses the
DataInputStream <code>inStream</code> and DataOutputStream
<code>outStream</code> it previously set up using the input and
output streams for the socket connection made with
SampleClient.</p>
<p>Here is the SampleServer context establishment loop:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">byte[] token = null;

while (!context.isEstablished()) {

    token = new byte[inStream.readInt()];
    System.out.println("Will read input token of size "
       + token.length
       + " for processing by acceptSecContext");
    inStream.readFully(token);
    
    token = context.<b>acceptSecContext</b>(token, 0, token.length);
    
    // Send a token to the peer if one was generated by
    // acceptSecContext
    if (token != null) {
        System.out.println("Will send token of size "
           + token.length
           + " from acceptSecContext.");
        outStream.writeInt(token.length);
        outStream.write(token);
        outStream.flush();
    }
}

System.out.print("Context Established! ");
System.out.println("Client is " + context.getSrcName());
System.out.println("Server is " + context.getTargName());

<h3>Exchanging Messages Securely</h3>
<p>Once a security context has been established between
SampleClient and SampleServer, they can use the context to securely
exchange messages.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#MsgPrepMethods">GSSContext Methods for Message
Exchange</a></li>
<li><a href="#SCandSSMsgExchanges">The SampleClient and
SampleServer Message Exchanges</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="MsgPrepMethods" id="MsgPrepMethods"></a>
<h3>GSSContext Methods for Message Exchange</h3>
<p>Two types of methods exist for preparing messages for secure
exchange: <code>wrap</code> and <code>getMIC</code>. There are
actually two <code>wrap</code> methods (and two <code>getMIC</code>
methods), where the differences between the two are the indication
of where the input message is (a byte array or an input stream) and
where the output should go (to a byte array return value or to an
output stream).</p>
<p>These methods for preparing messages for exchange, and the
corresponding methods for interpretation by the peer of the
resulting tokens, are described below.</p>
<h3>wrap</h3>
<p>The <code>wrap</code> method is the primary method for message
exchanges.</p>
<p>The signature for the <code>wrap</code> method called by
SampleClient is the following:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">byte[] wrap (byte[] inBuf, int offset, interface len, 
                MessageProp msgProp)</pre>
                
<p>You pass <code>wrap</code> a message (in <code>inBuf</code>),
the offset into <code>inBuf</code> where the message begins
(<code>offset</code>), and the length of the message
(<code>len</code>). You also pass a MessageProp, which is used to
indicate the desired QOP (Quality-of-Protection) and to specify
whether or not privacy (encryption) is desired. A QOP value selects
the cryptographic integrity and encryption (if requested)
algorithm(s) to be used. The algorithms corresponding to various
QOP values are specified by the provider of the underlying
mechanism. For example, the values for Kerberos V5 are defined in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1964.txt">RFC 1964</a> in
section 4.2. It is common to specify 0 as the QOP value to request
the default QOP.</p>
<p>The <code>wrap</code> method returns a token containing the
message and a cryptographic Message Integrity Code (MIC) over it.
The message placed in the token will be encrypted if the
MessageProp indicates privacy is desired. You do not need to know
the format of the returned token; it should be treated as opaque
data. You send the returned token to your peer application, which
calls the <code>unwrap</code> method to "unwrap" the token to get
the original message and to verify its integrity.</p>
<h3>getMIC</h3>
<p>If you simply want to get a token containing a cryptographic
Message Integrity Code (MIC) for a supplied message, you call
<code>getMIC</code>. A sample reason you might want to do this is
to confirm with your peer that you both have the same data, by just
transporting a MIC for that data without incurring the cost of
transporting the data itself to each other.</p>
<p>The signature for the <code>getMIC</code> method called by
SampleServer is the following:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">byte[] getMIC (byte[] inMsg, int offset, int len,
            MessageProp msgProp)</pre>
            
<p>You pass <code>getMIC</code> a message (in <code>inMsg</code>),
the offset into <code>inMsg</code> where the message begins
(<code>offset</code>), and the length of the message
(<code>len</code>). You also pass a <b>MessageProp</b>, which is
used to indicate the desired QOP (Quality-of-Protection). It is
common to specify 0 as the QOP value to request the default
QOP.</p>
<p>If you have a token created by <code>getMIC</code> and the
message used to calculate the MIC (or a message purported to be the
message on which the MIC was calculated), you can call the
<code>verifyMIC</code> method to verify the MIC for the message. If
the verification is successful (that is, if a GSSException is not
thrown), it proves that the message is exactly the same as it was
when the MIC was calculated. A peer receiving a message from an
application typically expects a MIC as well, so that they can
verify the MIC and be assured the message has not been modified or
corrupted in transit. Note: If you know ahead of time that you will
want the MIC as well as the message then it is more convenient to
use the <code>wrap</code> and <code>unwrap</code> methods. But
there could be situations where the message and the MIC are
received separately.</p>
<p>The signature for the <code>verifyMIC</code> corresponding to
the <code>getMIC</code> shown above is</p>

<pre class="codeblock">void verifyMIC (byte[] inToken, int tokOffset, int tokLen,
        byte[] inMsg, int msgOffset, int msgLen,
        MessageProp msgProp);</pre>
        
<p>This verifies the MIC contained in the <code>inToken</code> (of
length <code>tokLen</code>, starting at offset
<code>tokOffset</code>) over the message contained in
<code>inMsg</code> (of length <code>msgLen</code>, starting at
offset <code>msgOffset</code>). The MessageProp is used by the
underlying mechanism to return information to the caller, such as
the QOP indicating the strength of protection that was applied to
the message.</p>
<a name="SCandSSMsgExchanges" id="SCandSSMsgExchanges"></a>
<h3>The SampleClient and SampleServer Message Exchanges</h3>
<p>The message exchanges between SampleClient and SampleServer are
summarized below, followed by the coding details.</p>
<p>These steps are the "standard" steps used for verifying a
GSS-API client and server. A group at MIT has written a GSS-API
client and a GSS-API server that have become fairly popular test
programs for checking interoperability between different
implementations of the GSS-API library. (These GSS-API sample
applications can be downloaded as a part of the Kerberos
distribution available from MIT at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/">http://web.mit.edu/kerberos</a>.)
This client and server from MIT follow the protocol that once the
context is established, the client sends a message across and it
expects back the MIC on that message. If you implement a GSS-API
library, it is common practice to test it by running either the
client or server using your library implementation against a
corresponding peer server or client that uses another GSS-API
library implementation. If both library implementations conform to
the standards, then the two peers will be able to communicate
successfully.</p>
<p>One implication of testing your client or server against ones
written in C (like the MIT ones) is the way tokens must be
exchanged. C implementations of GSS-API do not include stream-based
methods. In the absence of stream-based methods on your peer, when
you write a token you must first write the number of bytes and then
write the token. Similarly, when you are reading a token, you first
read the number of bytes and then read the token. This is what
SampleClient and SampleServer do.</p>
<p>Here is the summary of the SampleClient and SampleServer message
exchanges:</p>
<ol>
<li>SampleClient calls <code>wrap</code> to encrypt and calculate a
MIC for a message.</li>
<li>SampleClient sends the token returned from <code>wrap</code> to
SampleServer.</li>
<li>SampleServer calls <code>unwrap</code> to obtain the original
message and verify its integrity.</li>
<li>SampleServer calls <code>getMIC</code> to calculate a MIC on
the decrypted message.</li>
<li>SampleServer sends the token returned by <code>getMIC</code>
(which contains the MIC) to SampleClient.</li>
<li>SampleClient calls <code>verifyMIC</code> to verify that the
MIC sent by SampleServer is a valid MIC for the original
message.</li>
</ol>
<h3>SampleClient Code to Encrypt the Message and Send It</h3>
<p>The SampleClient code for encrypting a message, calculating a
MIC for it, and sending the result to SampleServer is the
following:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">byte[] messageBytes = "Hello There!\0".getBytes();

/*
 * The first MessageProp argument is 0 to request
 * the default Quality-of-Protection.
 * The second argument is true to request
 * privacy (encryption of the message).
 */
MessageProp prop =  new MessageProp(0, true);

/*
 * Encrypt the data and send it across. Integrity protection
 * is always applied, irrespective of encryption.
 */
token = context.<b>wrap</b>(messageBytes, 0, messageBytes.length, 
    prop);
System.out.println("Will send wrap token of size " 
    + token.length);
outStream.writeInt(token.length);
outStream.write(token);
outStream.flush();</pre>

<h3>SampleServer Code to Unwrap Token, Calculate MIC, and Send
It</h3>

<p>The following SampleServer code reads the wrapped token sent by
SampleClient and "unwraps" it to obtain the original message and
have its integrity verified. The unwrapping in this case includes
decryption since the message was encrypted.</p>
<p>Note: Here the integrity check is expected to succeed. But note
that in general if an integrity check fails it signifies that the
message was changed in transit. If the <code>unwrap</code> method
encounters an integrity check failure, it throws a GSSException
with major error code GSSException.BAD_MIC.</p>

<pre class="codeblock">/*
 * Create a MessageProp which unwrap will use to return 
 * information such as the Quality-of-Protection that was 
 * applied to the wrapped token, whether or not it was 
 * encrypted, etc. Since the initial MessageProp values
 * are ignored, it doesn't matter what they are set to.
 */
MessageProp prop = new MessageProp(0, false);

/* 
 * Read the token. This uses the same token byte array 
 * as that used during context establishment.
 */
token = new byte[inStream.readInt()];
System.out.println("Will read token of size " 
    + token.length);
inStream.readFully(token);

byte[] bytes = context.<b>unwrap</b>(token, 0, token.length, prop);
String str = new String(bytes);
System.out.println("Received data \""
    + str + "\" of length " + str.length());
System.out.println("Encryption applied: "
    + prop.getPrivacy());</pre>
    
<p>Next, SampleServer generates a MIC for the decrypted message and
sends it to SampleClient. This is not really necessary but simply
illustrates generating a MIC on the decrypted message, which should
be exactly the same as the original message SampleClient wrapped
and sent to SampleServer. When SampleServer generates this and
sends it to SampleClient, and SampleClient verifies it, this proves
to SampleClient that the decrypted message SampleServer has is in
fact exactly the same as the original message from
SampleClient.</p>

<pre class="codeblock">/*
 * First reset the QOP of the MessageProp to 0
 * to ensure the default Quality-of-Protection
 * is applied.
 */
prop.setQOP(0);

token = context.<b>getMIC</b>(bytes, 0, bytes.length, prop);

System.out.println("Will send MIC token of size " 
                   + token.length);
outStream.writeInt(token.length);
outStream.write(token);
outStream.flush();</pre>

<h3>SampleClient Code to Verify the MIC</h3>

<p>The following SampleClient code reads the MIC calculated by
SampleServer on the decrypted message and then verifies that the
MIC is a MIC for the original message, proving that the decrypted
message SampleServer has is the same as the original message:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">token = new byte[inStream.readInt()];
System.out.println("Will read token of size " + token.length);
inStream.readFully(token);

/* 
 * Recall messageBytes is the byte array containing
 * the original message and prop is the MessageProp 
 * already instantiated by SampleClient.
 */
context.<b>verifyMIC</b>(token, 0, token.length, 
          messageBytes, 0, messageBytes.length,
          prop);

System.out.println("Verified received MIC for message.");</pre>

<a name="Cleanup" id="Cleanup"></a>

<h3>Clean Up</h3>
When SampleClient and SampleServer have finished exchanging
messages, they need to perform cleanup operations. Both contain the
following code to
<ul>
<li>close the socket connection and</li>
<li>release system resources and cryptographic information stored
in the context object and then invalidate the context.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="codeblock">socket.close();
context.dispose();</pre>

<a name="KerbNames" id="KerbNames"></a>

<h2>Kerberos User and Service Principal Names</h2>
<p>Since the underlying authentication and secure communication
technology used by this tutorial is Kerberos V5, we use
Kerberos-style <a href="glossary.html">principal</a> names wherever
a user or service is called for.</p>
<p>For example, when you run SampleClient you are asked to provide
your <b>user name</b>. Your Kerberos-style user name is simply the
user name you were assigned for Kerberos authentication. It
consists of a base user name (like "mjones") followed by an "@" and
your realm (like "mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM").</p>
<p>A server program like SampleServer is typically considered to
offer a "service" and to be run on behalf of a particular
"<b>service principal</b>." A service principal name for
SampleServer is needed in several places:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you run SampleServer, and SampleClient attempts a
connection to it, the underlying Kerberos mechanism will attempt to
authenticate to the Kerberos KDC. It prompts you to log in. You
should log in as the appropriate service principal.</li>
<li>When you run SampleClient, one of the arguments is the service
principal name. This is needed so SampleClient can initiate
establishment of a security context with the appropriate
service.</li>
<li>If the SampleClient and SampleServer programs were run with a
security manager (they're not for this tutorial), the client and
server policy files would each require a ServicePermission with
name equal to the service principal name and action equal to
"initiate" or "accept" (for initiating or accepting establishment
of a security context).</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this document, and in the accompanying login
configuration file,</p>

<pre class="codeblock">service_principal@your_realm</pre>

is used as a placeholder to be replaced by the actual name to be
used in your environment. <i>Any</i> Kerberos principal can
actually be used for the service principal name. So <b>for the
purposes of trying out this tutorial, you could use your user name
as both the client user name and the service principal name.</b>
<p>In a production environment, system administrators typically
like servers to be run as specific principals only and may assign a
particular name to be used. Often the Kerberos-style service
principal name assigned is of the form</p>

<pre class="codeblock">service_name/machine_name@realm;</pre>

<p>For example, an nfs service run on a machine named "raven" in
the realm named "KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM" could have the
service principal name</p>

<pre class="codeblock">nfs/raven@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM</pre>

<p>Such multi-component names are not required, however.
Single-component names, just like those of user principals, can be
used. For example, an installation might use the same ftp service
principal <code>ftp@realm</code> for all ftp servers in that realm,
while another installation might have different ftp principals for
different ftp servers, such as <code>ftp/host1@realm</code> and
<code>ftp/host2@realm</code> on machines <code>host1</code> and
<code>host2</code>, respectively.</p>
<h3>When the Realm is Required in Principal Names</h3>
<p>If the realm of a user or service principal name is the default
realm (see <a href="KerberosReq.html">Kerberos Requirements</a>),
you can leave off the realm when you are logging into Kerberos
(that is, when you are prompted for your username). Thus, for
example, if your user name is
"mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM", and you run SampleClient,
when it requests your user name you could just specify "mjones",
leaving off the realm. The name is interpreted in the context of
being a Kerberos principal name and the default realm is appended,
as needed.</p>
<p>You can also leave off the realm if a principal name will be
converted to a GSSName by a GSSManager <code>createName</code>
method. For example, when you run SampleClient, one of the
arguments is the server service principal name. You can specify the
name without including the realm, because SampleClient passes the
name to such a <code>createName</code> method, which appends the
default realm as needed.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you always include realms when principal
names are used in login configuration files and policy files,
because the behavior of the parsers for such files may be
implementation-dependent; they may or may not append the default
realm before such names are utilized and subsequent actions may
fail if there is no realm in the name.</p>

<h2>The Login Configuration File</h2>
<p>For this tutorial, we are letting the underlying Kerberos
mechanism obtain credentials of the users running SampleClient and
SampleServer, rather than invoking JAAS methods directly (as in the
<a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> and <a href=
"AcnAndAzn.html">JAAS Authorization</a> tutorials) or indirectly
(for example, via the Login utility described in the <a href=
"LoginSample.html">Use of JAAS Login Utility</a> tutorial and in
the <a href="ClientServer.html">Use of JAAS Login Utility and Java
GSS-API for Secure Message Exchanges</a> tutorial).</p>
<p>The default Kerberos mechanism implementation supplied by Sun
Microsystems actually prompts for a Kerberos name and password and
authenticates the specified user (or service) to the Kerberos KDC.
The mechanism relies on JAAS to perform this authentication.</p>
<p>JAAS supports a pluggable authentication framework, meaning that
any type of authentication module can be plugged under a calling
application. A login configuration specifies the login module to be
used for a particular application. The default JAAS implementation
from Sun Microsystems requires that the login configuration
information be specified in a file. (Note: Some other vendors might
not have file-based implementations.) See <a href=
"LoginConfigFile.html">JAAS Login Configuration File</a> for
information as to what a login configuration file is, what it
contains, and how to specify which login configuration file should
be used.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, the Kerberos login module
<code>com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule</code> is
specified in the configuration file. This login module prompts for
a Kerberos name and password and attempts to authenticate to the
Kerberos KDC.</p>
<p>Both SampleClient and SampleServer can use the same login
configuration file, if that file contains two entries, one entry
for the client side and one for the server side.</p>
<p>The <a href="bcsLogin.conf">bcsLogin.conf</a> login
configuration file used for this tutorial is the following:</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b>com.sun.security.jgss.initiate</b>  {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required;
};

<b>com.sun.security.jgss.accept</b>  {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required storeKey=true 
};</pre>

<p>Entries with these two names
(<code>com.sun.security.jgss.initiate</code> and
<code>com.sun.security.jgss.accept</code>) are used by Sun
implementations of GSS-API mechanisms when they need new
credentials. Since the mechanism used in this tutorial is the
Kerberos V5 mechanism, a Kerberos login module will need to be
invoked in order to obtain these credentials. Thus we list
Krb5LoginModule as a required module in these entries. The
<code>com.sun.security.jgss.initiate</code> entry specifies the
configuration for the client side and the
<code>com.sun.security.jgss.accept</code> entry for the server
side.</p>
<p>The Krb5LoginModule succeeds only if the attempt to log in to
the Kerberos KDC as a specified entity is successful. When running
SampleClient or SampleServer, the user will be prompted for a name
and password.</p>
<p>The SampleServer entry <b><code>storeKey=true</code></b>
indicates that a secret key should be calculated from the password
provided during login and it should be stored in the private
credentials of the Subject created as a result of login. This key
is subsequently utilized during mutual authentication when
establishing a security context between SampleClient and
SampleServer.</p>
<p>For information about all the possible options that can be
passed to Krb5LoginModule, see the <a href=
"../../../../../jre/api/security/jaas/spec/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html">
Krb5LoginModule documentation</a>.</p>
<a name="useSub" id="useSub"></a>
<h2>The useSubjectCredsOnly System Property</h2>
<p>For this tutorial, we set the system property
<code>javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly</code> to
<code>false</code>, which allows us to relax the usual restriction
of requiring a GSS mechanism to obtain necessary credentials from
an existing <a href="glossary.html">Subject</a>, set up by JAAS.
When this restriction is relaxed, it allows the mechanism to obtain
credentials from some vendor-specific location. For example, some
vendors might choose to use the operating system's cache if one
exists, while others might choose to read from a protected file on
disk.</p>
<p>When this restriction is relaxed, Sun Microsystem's Kerberos
mechanism still looks for the credentials in the Subject associated
with the thread's access control context, but if it doesn't find
any there, it performs JAAS authentication using a Kerberos module
to obtain new ones. The Kerberos module prompts you for a Kerberos
principal name and password. Note that Kerberos mechanism
implementations from other vendors may behave differently when this
property is set to <code>false</code>. Consult their documentation
to determine their implementation's behavior.</p>

<h2>Running the SampleClient and SampleServer Programs</h2>
<p>To execute the SampleClient and SampleServer programs, do the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#PrepSS">Prepare SampleServer for Execution</a></li>
<li><a href="#PrepSC">Prepare SampleClient for Execution</a></li>
<li><a href="#ExecSS">Execute SampleServer</a></li>
<li><a href="#ExecSC">Execute SampleClient</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="PrepSS" id="PrepSS"></a>
<h3>Prepare SampleServer for Execution</h3>
<p>To prepare SampleServer for execution, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the following files into a directory accessible by the
machine on which you will run SampleServer:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="SampleServer.java">SampleServer.java</a> source
file.</li>
<li>The <a href="bcsLogin.conf">bcsLogin.conf</a> login
configuration file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compile <code>SampleServer.java</code>:

<pre class="codeblock">javac SampleServer.java</pre>

</li>
</ol>
<a name="PrepSC" id="PrepSC"></a>
<h3>Prepare SampleClient for Execution</h3>
<p>To prepare SampleClient for execution, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the following files into a directory accessible by the
machine on which you will run SampleClient:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="SampleClient.java">SampleClient.java</a> source
file.</li>
<li>The <a href="bcsLogin.conf">bcsLogin.conf</a> login
configuration file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compile <code>SampleClient.java</code>:
<pre class="codeblock">javac SampleClient.java</pre></li>
</ol>
<a name="ExecSS" id="ExecSS"></a>

<h3>Execute SampleServer</h3>

<p>It is important to execute SampleServer before SampleClient
because SampleClient will try to make a socket connection to
SampleServer and that will fail if SampleServer is not yet running
and accepting socket connections.</p>
<p>To execute SampleServer, be sure to run it on the machine it is
expected to be run on. This machine name (host name) is specified
as an argument to SampleClient. The service principal name appears
in several places, including the login configuration file and the
policy files.</p>
<p>Go to the directory in which you have prepared SampleServer for
execution. Execute SampleServer, specifying</p>
<ul>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt;</code>
that your Kerberos realm is the one specified. For example, if your
realm is "KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM" you'd put
<code>-Djava.security.krb5.realm=KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM</code>.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> that
your Kerberos KDC is the one specified. For example, if your KDC is
"samplekdc.example.com" you'd put
<code>-Djava.security.krb5.kdc=samplekdc.example.com</code>.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djavax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly=false</code>
that the underlying mechanism can decide how to get credentials.
See <a href="#useSub">The useSubjectCredsOnly System
Property</a>.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=bcsLogin.conf</code>
that the login configuration file to be used is
<code>bcsLogin.conf</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only argument required by SampleServer is one specifying the
port number to be used for listening for client connections. Choose
a high port number unlikely to be used for anything else. An
example would be something like 4444.</p>
<p>Below is the full command to use for both Microsoft Windows and
Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems.</p>
<p><b>Important: In this command, you must replace
<code>&lt;port_number&gt;</code> with an appropriate port number,
<code>&lt;your_realm&gt;</code> with your Kerberos realm, and
<code>&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> with your Kerberos KDC.</b></p>
<p>Here is the command:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">java -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djavax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly=false
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=bcsLogin.conf 
 SampleServer &lt;port_number&gt;</pre>
 
<p>The full command should appear on one line
(or, on Solaris, Linux, or Mac OS X systems,
on multiple lines where each line but the last is terminated with "
\" indicating that there is more to come). Multiple lines are used
here just for legibility. Since this command is very long, you may
need to place it in a .bat file (for Windows) or a .sh file (for
Solaris, Linux, or Mac OS X) and then run that file to execute
the command.</p>
<p>The <code>SampleServer</code> code will listen for socket
connections on the specified port. When prompted, type the Kerberos
name and password for the service principal. The underlying
Kerberos authentication mechanism specified in the login
configuration file will log the service principal into
Kerberos.</p>

<h3>Execute SampleClient</h3>
<p>To execute SampleClient, first go to the directory in which you
have prepared SampleClient for execution. Execute SampleClient,
specifying</p>
<ul>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt;</code>
that your Kerberos realm is the one specified.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> that
your Kerberos KDC is the one specified.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djavax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly=false</code>
that the underlying mechanism can decide how to get
credentials.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=bcsLogin.conf</code>
that the login configuration file to be used is
<code>bcsLogin.conf</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SampleClient arguments are (1) <a href="#KerbNames">the
Kerberos name of the service principal that represents
SampleServer</a>, (2) the name of the host (machine) on which
SampleServer is running, and (3) the port number on which
SampleServer is listening for client connections.</p>
<p>Below is the full command to use for both Windows and 
Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems.</p>
<p><b>Important: In this command, you must replace
<code>&lt;service_principal&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;host&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;port_number&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;your_realm&gt;</code>,
and <code>&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> with appropriate values</b> (and
note that the port number must be the same as the port number
passed as an argument to SampleServer). These values need not be
placed in quotes.</p>
<p>Here is the command:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">java -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djavax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly=false
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=bcsLogin.conf 
 SampleClient &lt;service_principal&gt; &lt;host&gt; &lt;port_number&gt;</pre>
 
<p>Type the full command on one line. Multiple lines are used here
for legibility. As with the command for executing SampleServer, if
the command is too long to type directly into your command window,
place it in a .bat file (Windows) or a .sh file (Solaris, Linux,
and Mac OS X) and then execute that file.</p>
<p>When prompted, type your Kerberos user name and password. The
underlying Kerberos authentication mechanism specified in the login
configuration file will log you into Kerberos. The SampleClient
code requests a socket connection with SampleServer. Once
SampleServer accepts the connection, SampleClient and SampleServer
establish a shared context and then exchange messages as described
in this tutorial.</p>
