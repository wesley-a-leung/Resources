<h1>JAAS Authorization</h1>

<br />
<p>This tutorial expands the program and policy file developed in
the <a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial to
demonstrate the JAAS authorization component, which ensures the
authenticated caller has the access control rights (permissions)
required to do subsequent security-sensitive operations. Since the
authorization component requires that the user authentication first
be completed, please read the <a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS
Authentication</a> tutorial first if you have not already done
so.</p>
<p>The rest of this tutorial consists of the following
sections:</p>

Tutorial Code</a> and then go back to the other sections to learn

<h2><a name="WhatIsAzn" id="WhatIsAzn">What is JAAS
Authorization?</a></h2>
<p>JAAS authorization extends the existing Java security
architecture that uses a security <a href=
"../../PolicyFiles.html">policy</a> to specify what access rights
are granted to executing code. That architecture, introduced in the
Java 2 platform, is <i>code-centric</i>. That is, the permissions
are granted based on code characteristics: where the code is coming
from and whether it is digitally signed and if so by whom. We saw
an example of this in the <code>jaasacn.policy</code> file used in
the <a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial. That
file contains the following:</p>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./JaasAcn.jar" {
   permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission 
                    "createLoginContext.JaasSample";
};
</pre>
<p>This grants the code in the <code>JaasAcn.jar</code> file,
located in the current directory, the specified permission. (No
signer is specified, so it doesn't matter whether the code is
signed or not.)</p>
<p>JAAS authorization augments the existing code-centric access
controls with new <i>user-centric</i> access controls. Permissions
can be granted based not just on what code is running but also on
<i>who</i> is running it.</p>
<p>When an application uses JAAS authentication to authenticate the
user (or other entity such as a service), a <a href=
"../../../../../api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html">Subject</a>
is created as a result. The purpose of the Subject is to represent
the authenticated user. A Subject is comprised of a set of <a href=
"../../../../../api/java/security/Principal.html">Principals</a>,
where each Principal represents an identity for that user. For
example, a Subject could have a name Principal ("Susan Smith") and
a Social Security Number Principal ("987-65-4321"), thereby
distinguishing this Subject from other Subjects.</p>
<p>Permissions can be granted in the policy to specific Principals.
After the user has been authenticated, the application can
associate the Subject with the current access control context. For
each subsequent security-checked operation, (a local file access,
for example), the Java runtime will automatically determine whether
the policy grants the required permission only to a specific
Principal and if so, the operation will be allowed only if the
Subject associated with the access control context contains the
designated Principal.</p>
<h2><a name="InvokingAzn" id="InvokingAzn">How is JAAS
Authorization Performed?</a></h2>
<p>To make JAAS authorization take place, the following is
required:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user must be authenticated, as described in the <a href=
"AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial.</li>
<li><a href="#UserPFStmts">Principal-based entries</a> must be
configured in the security policy.</li>
<li>The Subject that is the result of authentication must be
<a href="#AssocSubject">associated with the current access control
context</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="UserPFStmts" id="UserPFStmts">How Do You Make
Principal-Based Policy File Statements?</a></h3>
<p><a href="../../PolicyFiles.html">Policy file</a>
<code>grant</code> statements can now optionally include one or
more Principal fields. Inclusion of a Principal field indicates
that the user or other entity represented by the specified
Principal, executing the specified code, has the designated
permissions.</p>
<p>Thus, the basic format of a <code>grant</code> statement is
now</p>
<pre>
grant &lt;<i>signer(s) field</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>codeBase URL</i>&gt; 
  &lt;<i>Principal field(s)</i>&gt; {
    permission <i>perm_class_name</i> "<i>target_name</i>", "<i>action</i>";
    ....
    permission <i>perm_class_name</i> "<i>target_name</i>", "<i>action</i>";
  };
</pre>
where each of the signer, codeBase and Principal fields is optional
and the order between the fields doesn't matter.
<p>A Principal field looks like the following:</p>
<pre>
Principal <i>Principal_class</i> "<i>principal_name</i>"
</pre>
<p>That is, it is the word "Principal" (where case doesn't matter)
followed by the (fully qualified) name of a Principal class and a
principal name.</p>
<p>A Principal class is a class that implements the <a href=
"../../../../../api/java/security/Principal.html">java.security.Principal</a>
interface. All Principal objects have an associated name that can
be obtained by calling their <code>getName</code> method. The
format used for the name is dependent on each Principal
implementation.</p>
<p>The type of Principal placed in the Subject created by the
Kerberos authentication mechanism used by this tutorial is
<code>javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal</code>, so
that is what should be used as the
<code><i>Principal_class</i></code> part of our <code>grant</code>
statement's Principal designation. User names for
<code>KerberosPrincipal</code>s are of the form "name@realm". Thus,
if the user name is "mjones" and the realm is "KRBNT-OPS.ABC.COM",
the full <code><i>principal_name</i></code> designation to use in
the <code>grant</code> statement is "mjones@KRBNT-OPS.ABC.COM".</p>
<p>It is possible to include more than one Principal field in a
<code>grant</code> statement. If multiple Principal fields are
specified, then the permissions in that <code>grant</code>
statement are granted only if the Subject associated with the
current access control context contains <i>all</i> of those
Principals.</p>
<p>To grant the same set of permissions to different Principals,
create multiple <code>grant</code> statements where each lists the
permissions and contains a single Principal field designating one
of the Principals.</p>
<p>The policy file for this tutorial includes one
<code>grant</code> statement with a Principal field:</p>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./SampleAction.jar",
    Principal javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal 
        "your_user_name@your_realm"  {

   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
   permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
};
</pre>
where you substitute your Kerberos user name (complete with "@" and
realm) for "<code>your_user_name@your_realm</code>".
<p>This specifies that the indicated permissions are granted to the
specified principal executing the code in
<code>SampleAction.jar</code>.</p>
<h3><a name="AssocSubject" id="AssocSubject">How Do You Associate a
Subject with an Access Control Context?</a></h3>
<p>To create and associate a Subject with an access control
context, you need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user must first be authenticated, as described in <a href=
"AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a>.</li>
<li>The static <code>doAs</code> method from the Subject class must
be called, passing it an authenticated Subject and a <a href=
"../../../../../api/java/security/PrivilegedAction.html">java.security.PrivilegedAction</a>
or <a href=
"../../../../../api/java/security/PrivilegedExceptionAction.html">java.security.PrivilegedExceptionAction</a>.
(See <a href="../../doprivileged.html">API for Privileged
Blocks</a> for a comparison of PrivilegedAction and
PrivilegedExceptionAction.) The <code>doAs</code> method associates
the provided Subject with the current access control context and
then invokes the <code>run</code> method from the action. The
<code>run</code> method implementation contains all the code to be
executed as the specified Subject. The action thus executes as the
specified Subject.
<p>The static <code>doAsPrivileged</code> method from the Subject
class may be called instead of the <code>doAs</code> method. In
addition to the parameters passed to <code>doAs</code>,
<code>doAsPrivileged</code> requires a third parameter: an
AccessControlContext. Unlike <code>doAs</code>, which associates
the provided Subject with the current access control context,
<code>doAsPrivileged</code> associates the Subject with the
provided access control context. See <a href=
"../../jaas/JAASRefGuide.html#doAsComp">doAs vs. doAsPrivileged</a>
in the JAAS Reference Guide for a comparison of those methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="AznCode" id="AznCode">The Authorization Tutorial
Code</a></h2>
<p>The code for this tutorial consists of two files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="JaasAzn.java">JaasAzn.java</a> is exactly the same as
the <code>JaasAcn.java</code> from the <a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS
Authentication</a> tutorial except for the additional code needed
to call <code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code>.</li>
<li><a href="SampleAction.java">SampleAction.java</a> contains the
SampleAction class. This class implements PrivilegedAction and has
a <code>run</code> method that contains all the code we want to be
executed with Principal-based authorization checks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>JaasAzn.java</h3>
<p><a href="JaasAzn.java">JaasAzn.java</a> is exactly the same as
the <code>JaasAcn.java</code> code used in the previous tutorial
except with three statements added at the end of the
<code>main</code> method, after the authentication is done. These
statements result in (1) association of a Subject representing the
authenticated user with the current access control context and (2)
execution of the code in the <code>run</code> method of
SampleAction. Associating the Subject with the access control
context enables security-sensitive operations in the SampleAction
<code>run</code> method (and any code it invokes directly or
indirectly) to be executed if a Principal representing the
authenticated user is granted the required permissions in the
current policy.</p>
<p>Like <code>JaasAcn.java</code>, <code>JaasAzn.java</code>
instantiates a LoginContext <code>lc</code> and calls its
<code>login</code> method to perform the authentication. If
successful, the authenticated Subject (which includes a Principal
representing the user) is obtained by calling the LoginContext's
<code>getSubject</code> method:</p>
<pre>
Subject mySubject = lc.getSubject();
</pre>
<p>The <code>main</code> method then calls
<code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code>, passing it the authenticated
Subject <code>mySubject</code>, a PrivilegedAction (SampleAction)
and a <code>null</code> AccessControlContext, as described in the
following.</p>
<p>The SampleAction class is instantiated via the following:</p>
<pre>
PrivilegedAction action = new SampleAction();
</pre>
<p>The call to <code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code> is performed
via:</p>
<pre>
Subject.doAsPrivileged(mySubject, action, null);
</pre>
<p>The <code>doAsPrivileged</code> method invokes execution of the
<code>run</code> method in the PrivilegedAction <code>action</code>
(SampleAction) to initiate execution of the rest of the code, which
is considered to be executed on behalf of the Subject
<code>mySubject</code>.</p>
<p>Passing <code>null</code> as the AccessControlContext (third)
argument to <code>doAsPrivileged</code> indicates that
<code>mySubject</code> should be associated with a new empty
AccessControlContext. The result is that security checks occurring
during execution of SampleAction will only require permissions for
the SampleAction code itself (or other code it invokes), running as
<code>mySubject</code>. Note that the caller of
<code>doAsPrivileged</code> (and the callers on the execution stack
at the time <code>doAsPrivileged</code> was called) do not require
any permissions while the action executes.</p>
<h3><a name="SACode" id="SACode">SampleAction.java</a></h3>
<p><a href="SampleAction.java">SampleAction.java</a> contains the
SampleAction class. This class implements
<code>java.security.PrivilegedAction</code> and has a
<code>run</code> method that contains all the code we want to be
executed as the Subject <code>mySubject</code>. For this tutorial,
we will perform three operations, each of which cannot be done
unless code has been granted required permissions. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read and print the value of the <code>java.home</code> system
property,</li>
<li>Read and print the value of the <code>user.home</code> system
property, and</li>
<li>Determine whether or not a file named <code>foo.txt</code>
exists in the current directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre>
import java.io.File;
import java.security.PrivilegedAction;

public class <b>SampleAction</b> implements PrivilegedAction {

  public Object <b>run</b>() {

    System.out.println("\nYour java.home property value is: "
                + System.getProperty("java.home"));

    System.out.println("\nYour user.home property value is: "
                + System.getProperty("user.home"));

    File f = new File("foo.txt");
    System.out.print("\nfoo.txt does ");
    if (!f.exists())
        System.out.print("not ");
    System.out.println("exist in the current working directory.");
    return null;
  }
}
</pre>
<h2><a name="AznLCF" id="AznLCF">The Login Configuration
File</a></h2>
<p>The login configuration file used for this tutorial can be
exactly the same as that used by the <a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS
Authentication</a> tutorial. Thus we can use <a href=
"jaas.conf">jaas.conf</a>, which contains just one entry:</p>
<pre>
<b>JaasSample {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required;
};</b>
</pre>
<p>This entry is named "JaasSample" and that is the name that both
our tutorial applications <code>JaasAcn</code> and
<code>JaasAzn</code> use to refer to it. The entry specifies that
the LoginModule to be used to do the user authentication is the
Krb5LoginModule in the <code>com.sun.security.auth.module</code>
package and that this Krb5LoginModule is required to "succeed" in
order for authentication to be considered successful. The
Krb5LoginModule succeeds only if the name and password supplied by
the user are successfully used to log the user into the Kerberos
KDC.</p>
<h2><a name="AznPF" id="AznPF">The Policy File</a></h2>
<p>This authorization tutorial contains two classes,
<code>JaasAzn</code> and <code>SampleAction</code>. The code in
each class contains some security-sensitive operations and thus
relevant permissions are required in a policy file in order for the
operations to be executed.</p>
<h3>Permissions Required by JaasAzn</h3>
<p>The main method of the <code>JaasAzn</code> class does two
operations for which permissions are required. It</p>
<ul>
<li>creates a LoginContext, and</li>
<li>calls the <code>doAsPrivileged</code> static method of the
Subject class.</li>
</ul>
<p>The LoginContext creation is exactly the same as was done in the
authentication tutorial, and it thus needs the same
<code>javax.security.auth.AuthPermission</code> permission with
target "<code>createLoginContext.JaasSample</code>".</p>
<p>In order to call the <code>doAsPrivileged</code> method of the
Subject class, you need to have a
<code>javax.security.auth.AuthPermission</code> with target
"<code>doAsPrivileged</code>".</p>
<p>Assuming the <code>JaasAzn</code> class is placed in a JAR file
named <code>JaasAzn.jar</code>, these permissions can be granted to
the <code>JaasAzn</code> code via the following <code>grant</code>
statement in the policy file:</p>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./JaasAzn.jar" {
   permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission 
                    "createLoginContext.JaasSample";
   permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "doAsPrivileged";
};
</pre>
<a name="SampleActionPerms" id="SampleActionPerms"></a>
<h3>Permissions Required by SampleAction</h3>
<p>The <code>SampleAction</code> code does three operations for
which permissions are required. It</p>
<ul>
<li>reads the value of the "java.home" system property.</li>
<li>reads the value of the "user.home" system property.</li>
<li>checks to see whether or not a file named <code>foo.txt</code>
exists in the current directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The permissions required for these operations are the
following:</p>
<pre>
permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
</pre>
<p>We need to grant these permissions to the code in
<code>SampleAction.class</code>, which we will place in a JAR file
named <code>SampleAction.jar</code>. However, for this particular
<code>grant</code> statement we want to grant the permissions not
just to the <i>code</i> but to a specific user executing the code,
to demonstrate how to restrict access to a particular user.</p>
<p>Thus, as explained in <a href="#UserPFStmts">How Do You Make
Principal-Based Policy File Statements?</a>, our <code>grant</code>
statement looks like the following:</p>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./SampleAction.jar",
    Principal javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal 
        "your_user_name@your_realm"  {

   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
   permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
};
</pre>
You substitute your Kerberos user name (complete with "@" and
realm) for "<code>your_user_name@your_realm</code>". For example,
if your user name is "mjones" and your realm is
"KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM", you would use
"mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM" (complete with the quotes).
<h3>The Full Policy File</h3>
<p>The full policy file is <a href=
"jaasazn.policy">jaasazn.policy</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="RunAzn" id="RunAzn">Running the Authorization Tutorial
Code</a></h2>
<p>To execute our JAAS authorization tutorial code, all you have to
do is</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the following files into a directory:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="JaasAzn.java">JaasAzn.java</a> source file.</li>
<li>The <a href="SampleAction.java">SampleAction.java</a> source
file.</li>
<li>The <a href="jaas.conf">jaas.conf</a> login configuration
file.</li>
<li>The <a href="jaasazn.policy">jaasazn.policy</a> policy
file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replace "your_user_name@your_realm" in
<code>jaasazn.policy</code> with your user name and realm.</li>
<li>Compile <code>SampleAction.java</code> and
<code>JaasAzn.java</code>:
<pre>
javac SampleAction.java JaasAzn.java
</pre></li>
<li>Create a JAR file named <code>JaasAzn.jar</code> containing
<code>JaasAzn.class</code>:
<pre>
jar -cvf JaasAzn.jar JaasAzn.class
</pre></li>
<li>Create a JAR file named <code>SampleAction.jar</code>
containing <code>SampleAction.class</code>:
<pre>
jar -cvf SampleAction.jar SampleAction.class
</pre></li>
<li>Execute the <code>JaasAzn</code> application, specifying
<ol>
<li>by an appropriate <code>-classpath</code> clause that classes
should be searched for in the <code>JaasAzn.jar</code> and
<code>SampleAction.jar</code> JAR files,</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.manager</code> that a security manager
should be installed,</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt;</code>
that your Kerberos realm is the one specified.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> that
your Kerberos KDC is the one specified.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.policy=jaasazn.policy</code> that the
policy file to be used is <code>jaasazn.policy</code>, and</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas.conf</code>
that the login configuration file to be used is
<code>jaas.conf</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below are the full commands to use for both Microsoft Windows
and Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems.
The only difference is that on Windows systems
you use semicolons to separate classpath items, while you use
colons for that purpose on Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X.
<b>Be sure to replace
<code>&lt;your_realm&gt;</code> with your Kerberos realm, and
<code>&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> with your Kerberos KDC.</b></p>
<p>Here is the full command for Windows systems:</p>
<pre>
java -classpath JaasAzn.jar;SampleAction.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djava.security.policy=jaasazn.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas.conf JaasAzn
</pre>
<p>Here is the full command for Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems:</p>
<pre>
java -classpath JaasAzn.jar:SampleAction.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djava.security.policy=jaasazn.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas.conf JaasAzn
</pre>
<p>Type the full command on one line. Multiple lines are used here
for legibility. If the command is too long for your system, you may
need to place it in a .bat file (for Windows) or a .sh file (for
Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X) and then run that file to
execute the command.</p>
<p>You will be prompted for your Kerberos user name and password,
and the underlying Kerberos authentication mechanism specified in
the login configuration file will log you into Kerberos. If your
login is successful, you will see the message "Authentication
succeeded!" and if not, you will see "Authentication Failed."</p>
<p>For login troubleshooting suggestions, see <a href=
"Troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a>.</p>
<p>Once authentication is successfully completed, the rest of the
program (in <code>SampleAction</code>) will be executed on behalf
of you, the user, requiring you to have been granted appropriate
permissions. The <code>jaasazn.policy</code> policy file grants you
the required permissions, so you will see a display of the values
of your <code>java.home</code> and <code>user.home</code> system
properties and a statement as to whether or not you have a file
named <code>foo.txt</code> in the current directory.</p>
