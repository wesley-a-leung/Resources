<h1>Single Sign-on Using Kerberos in Java</h1>
<h2>Mayank Upadhyay<br />
Ram Marti</h2>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>A significant enhancement to the Java security architecture is
the capability to achieve single sign-on using Kerberos Version 5
in the next release of Java Standard Edition (J2SE). A single
sign-on solution lets users authenticate themselves just once to
access information on any of several systems. This is done using
JAAS for authentication and authorization and Java GSS-API to
establish a secure context for communication with a peer
application. Our focus is on Kerberos V5 as the underlying security
mechanism for single sign-on, although other security mechanisms
may be added in the future.</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>With the increasing use of distributed systems users need to
access resources that are often remote. Traditionally users have
had to sign-on to multiple systems, each of which may involve
different usernames and authentication techniques. In contrast,
with single sign-on, the user needs to authenticate only once and
the authenticated identity is securely carried across the network
to access resources on behalf of the user.</p>
<p>In this paper we discuss how to use single sign-on based on the
Kerberos V5 protocol. We use the Java Authentication and
Authorization Service (JAAS) to authenticate a principal to
Kerberos and obtain credentials that prove its identity. We show
how Sun's implementation of a Kerberos login module can be made to
read credentials from an existing cache on platforms that contain
native Kerberos support. We then use the Java Generic Security
Service API (Java GSS-API) to authenticate to a remote peer using
the previously obtained Kerberos credentials. We also show how to
delegate Kerberos credentials for single sign-on in a multi-tier
environment.</p>
<h2>KERBEROS V5</h2>
<p>Kerberos V5 is a trusted third party network authentication
protocol designed to provide strong authentication using secret key
cryptography. When using Kerberos V5, the user's password is never
sent across the network, not even in encrypted form, except during
Kerberos V5 administration. Kerberos was developed in the
mid-1980's as part of MIT's Project Athena. A full description of
the Kerberos V5 protocol is beyond the scope of this paper. For
more information on the Kerberos V5 protocol please refer to [1]
and [2]</p>
<p>Kerberos V5 is a mature protocol and has been widely deployed.
It is available on Solaris as SEAM and on Windows 2000 and several
other platforms. A free reference implementation in C is available
from MIT. For these reasons we have selected Kerberos V5 as the
underlying technology for single sign-on in J2SE.</p>
<h2>JAVA AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION SERVICE
(JAAS)</h2>
<p>Until recently the Java 2 security architecture solely
determined privileges by the origin of the code and the public key
certificates matching the code signers. However, in a multi-user
environment it is desirable to further specify privileges based on
the authenticated identity of the user running the code.</p>
<p>JAAS supplies such a capability. JAAS is a pluggable framework
and programming interface specifically targeted for authentication
and access control based on the authenticated identities.</p>
<h3>Authentication and Authorization</h3>
<p>The JAAS framework can be divided into two components: an
authentication component and an authorization component.</p>
<p>The JAAS authentication component provides the ability to
reliably and securely determine who is currently executing Java
code, regardless of whether the code is running as an application,
an applet, a bean, or a servlet.</p>
<p>The JAAS authorization component supplements the existing Java
security framework by providing the means to restrict the executing
Java code from performing sensitive tasks, depending on its
codesource and depending on who is executing the code.</p>
<h3>Pluggable and Stackable Framework</h3>
<p>JAAS authentication framework is based on Pluggable
Authentication Module (PAM)[3, 4]. JAAS authentication is performed
in a pluggable fashion allowing system administrators to add
appropriate authentication modules. This permits Java applications
to remain independent of underlying authentication technologies,
and new or updated authentication technologies can be seamlessly
configured without requiring modifications to the application
itself.</p>
<p>JAAS authentication framework also supports the stacking of
authentication modules. Multiple modules can be specified and they
are invoked by the JAAS framework in the order they were specified.
The success of the overall authentication depends on the results of
the individual authentication modules.</p>
<h3>Subject</h3>
<p>JAAS uses the term Subject to refer to any entity that is the
source of a request to access resources. A Subject may be a user or
a service. Since an entity may have many names or principals JAAS
uses Subject as an extra layer of abstraction that handles multiple
names per entity.Thus a Subject is comprised of a set of
principals. There are no restrictions on principal names.</p>
<p>A Subject is only populated with authenticated principals.
Authentication typically involves the user providing proof of
identity, such as a password.</p>
<p>A Subject may also have security related attributes, which are
referred to as credentials. The credentials can be public or
private. Sensitive credentials such as private cryptographic keys
are stored in the private credentials set of the Subject.</p>
<p>The Subject class has methods to retrieve the principals, public
credentials and private credentials associated with it.</p>
<p>Please note that different permissions may be required for
operations on these classes. For example
AuthPermission("modifyPrincipals") may be required to modify the
principal set of the Subject. Similar permissions are required to
modify the public credentials, private credentials and to get the
current Subject.</p>
<h3>doAs and doAsPrivileged</h3>
<p>Java 2 enforces runtime access controls via
java.lang.SecurityManager. The SecurityManager is consulted anytime
sensitive operations are attempted. The SecurityManager delegates
this responsibility to java.security.AccessController. The
AccessController obtains a current image of the
AccessControlContext and verifies that it has sufficient permission
to do the operation requested.</p>
<p>JAAS provides two methods doAs and doAsPrivileged that can be
used to associate an authenticated Subject with the
AccessControlContext dynamically.</p>
<p>The doAs method associates the Subject with the current thread's
access control context and subsequent access control checks are
made on the basis of the code being executed and the Subject
executing it.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
public static Object doAs(final Subject subject,
                          final  PrivilegedAction action)

public static Object doAs(final Subject subject,
                          final  PrivilegedExceptionAction action)
    throws  PrivilegedActionException;
</pre>
<p>Both forms of the doAs method first associate the specified
subject with the current Thread's AccessControlContext, and then
execute the action. This achieves the effect of having the action
run as the Subject. The first method can throw runtime exceptions
but normal execution has it returning an Object from the run()
method of its action argument. The second method behaves similarly
except that it can throw a checked PrivilegedActionException from
its run() method. An AuthPermission("doAs") is required to call the
doAs methods.</p>
<p>The following methods also execute code as a particular
Subject:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
public static Object doAsPrivileged(final Subject subject,
                                    final  PrivilegedAction action,
                                    final  AccessControlContext  acc);

public static Object doAsPrivileged(final Subject subject,
                                    final PrivilegedExceptionAction action,
                                    final  AccessControlContext acc)
   throws PrivilegedActionException;
</pre>
<p>The doAsPrivileged method behaves exactly as doAs, except that
it allows the caller to specify an access control context. Thus it
effectively throws away the current AccessControlContext and
authorization decisions will be based on the AccessControlContext
passed in.</p>
<p>Since the AccessControlContext is set on a per thread basis,
different threads within the JVM can assume different identities.
The Subject associated with a specific AccessControlContext can be
retrieved by using the following method:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
public static Subject getSubject(final AccessControlContext acc);
</pre>
<h3>LoginContext</h3>
<p>The LoginContext class provides the basic methods used to
authenticate Subjects. It also allows an application to be
independent of the underlying authentication technologies. The
LoginContext consults a configuration that determines the
authentication services or LoginModules configured for a particular
application. If the application does not have a specific entry, it
defaults to the entry identified as "other".</p>
<p>To support the stackable nature of LoginModules, LoginContext
performs authentication in two phases. In the first phase or login
phase, it invokes each configured LoginModule to attempt the
authentication. If all the necessary LoginModules succeed, then
LoginContext enters the second phase where it invokes each
LoginModule again to formally commit the authentication process.
During this phase the Subject is populated with the authenticated
principals and their credentials. If either of the phase fails,
then the LoginContext invokes each configured module to abort the
entire authentication attempt. Each LoginModule then cleans up any
relevant state associated with the authentication attempt.</p>
<p>LoginContext has four constructors that can be used to
instantiate it. All of them require the configuration entry name to
be passed. In addition the Subject and/or a CallbackHandler can
also be passed to the constructors.</p>
<h3>Callbacks</h3>
<p>The login modules invoked by JAAS must be able to garner
information from the caller for authentication. For example the
Kerberos login module may require users to enter their Kerberos
password for authentication.</p>
<p>The LoginContext allows the application to specify a
callbackhandler that the underlying login modules use to interact
with users. There are two callback handlers available in Merlin
(J2SE 1.4) - one based on the command line and another based on a
GUI.</p>
<h3>LoginModules</h3>
<p>Sun provides an implementation of the UnixLoginModule,
NTLoginModule, JNDILoginModule, KeyStoreLoginModule and
Krb5LoginModule in Merlin. A smart card based JAAS login module is
available from GemPlus [5].</p>
<h3>The Kerberos Login Module</h3>
<p>The class com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule is Sun's
implementation of a login module for the Kerberos version 5
protocol. Upon successful authentication the Ticket Granting Ticket
(TGT) is stored in the Subject's private credentials set and the
Kerberos principal is stored in the Subject's principal set.</p>
<p>Based on certain configurable options, Krb5LoginModule can also
use an existing credentials cache, such as a native cache in the
operating system, to acquire the TGT and/or use a keytab file
containing the secret key to implicitly authenticate a principal.
Both the Solaris and Windows 2000 platforms contain a credentials
cache that Krb5LoginModule can use for fetching the TGT. Solaris
also contains a system wide keytab file that Krb5LoginModule can
use for fetching the secret key. On all platforms, Krb5LoginModule
supports options to set the file path to a ticket cache or keytab
file of choice. This is useful when third-party Kerberos support is
installed and Java integration is desired. Please consult the
documentation for Krb5LoginModule to learn about these options. In
the absence of a native cache or keytab, the user will be prompted
for the password and the TGT obtained from the KDC.</p>
<p>Figure 1 provides a sample JAAS login configuration entry for a
client application. In this example, Krb5LoginModule will use the
native ticket cache to get the TGT available in it. The
authenticated identity will be the identity of the Kerberos
principal that the TGT belongs to.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
SampleClient {
    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required <b>useTicketCache=true</b>
};
             Figure 1. Sample client  configuration entry
</pre>
<p>Figure 2 provides a sample login configuration entry for a
server application. With this configuration, the secret key from
the keytab is used to authenticate the principal
"nfs/bar.example.com" and both the TGT obtained from the Kerberos
KDC and the secret key are stored in the Subject's private
credentials set. The stored key may be used later to validate a
service ticket sent by a client (See the section on Java
GSS-API.)</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
SampleServer {
     com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule
         required <b>useKeyTab=true storeKey=true principal="nfs/bar.example.com"</b>
};

             Figure 2. Sample server configuration entry
</pre>
<p>In the client code example shown in Figure 3, the configuration
entry "SampleClient" will be used by the LoginContext. The
TextCallbackHandler class will be used to prompt the user for the
Kerberos password. Once the user has logged in, the Subject will be
populated with the Kerberos Principal name and the TGT. Thereafter
the user can execute code using Subject.doAs passing in the Subject
obtained from the LoginContext.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
LoginContext lc = null;

try {
        lc = new LoginContext(<b>"SampleClient"</b>, new TextCallbackHandler());
        // attempt authentication
        lc.login();
} catch (LoginException le) {
    ...
}

 // Now try to execute ClientAction as the authenticated Subject

 Subject mySubject = lc.getSubject();
 PrivilegedAction action = new <b>ClientAction</b>();
 Subject.doAs(mySubject, action);

            Figure 3. Sample client code
</pre>
<p>ClientAction could be an action that is allowed only for
authenticated Kerberos client Principals with a specific value.</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows server side sample code. It is similar to the
client code shown in Figure 4 except for the application entry name
and the PrivilegedAction.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
LoginContext lc = null;

try {
        lc = new LoginContext(<b>"SampleServer"</b>, new TextCallbackHandler());
        // attempt authentication
        lc.login();
} catch (LoginException le) {
   ...
}

// Now try to execute ServerAction as the authenticated Subject

Subject mySubject = lc.getSubject();
PrivilegedAction action = new <b>ServerAction</b>();
Subject.doAs(mySubject, action);

            Figure 4. Sample server code
</pre>
<h3>Kerberos Classes</h3>
<p>To enable other vendors to provide their own Kerberos login
module implementation that can be used with Java GSS-API, three
standard Kerberos classes have been introduced in the
javax.security.auth.kerberos package. These are KerberosPrincipal
for Kerberos principals, KerberosKey for the long-term Kerberos
secret key and KerberosTicket for Kerberos tickets. All
implementations of the Kerberos login module must use these classes
to store principals, keys and tickets in the Subject.</p>
<h3>Authorization</h3>
<p>Upon successful authentication of a Subject, access controls can
be enforced based upon the principals associated with the
authenticated Subject. The JAAS principal based access controls
augment the CodeSource access controls of Java 2. Permissions
granted to a Subject are configured in Policy, which is an abstract
class for representing the system wide access control policy. Sun
provides a file based implementation of the Policy class. The
Policy class is provider based so that others can provide their own
policy implementation.</p>
<h2>JAVA GENERIC SECURITY SERVICE APPLICATION
PROGRAM INTERFACE (Java GSS-API)</h2>
<h3>Generic Security Service API (GSS-API)</h3>
<p>Enterprise applications often have varying security requirements
and deploy a range of underlying technologies to achieve this. In
such a scenario how do we develop a client-server application so
that it can easily migrate from one technology to another? The
GSS-API was designed in the Common Authentication Technology
working group of the IETF to solve this problem by providing a
uniform application programming interface for peer to peer
authentication and secure communication that insulates the caller
from the details of the underlying technology.</p>
<p>The API, described in a language independent form in RFC 2743
[6], accommodates the following security services: authentication,
message confidentiality and integrity, sequencing of protected
messages, replay detection, and credential delegation. The
underlying security technology or "security mechanism" being used,
has a choice of supporting one or more of these features beyond the
essential one way authentication.<a class="footnote" href="#a1">Footnote 1</a>
</p>
<p>There are mainly two standard security
mechanisms that the IETF has defined: Kerberos V5 [6] and the
Simple Public Key Mechanism (SPKM) [8].</p>
<p>The API is designed such that an implementation may support
multiple mechanisms simultaneously, giving the application the
ability to choose one at runtime. Mechanisms are identified by
means of unique object identifier's (OID's) that are registered
with the IANA. For instance, the Kerberos V5 mechanism is
identified by the OID {iso(1) member-body(2) United States(840)
mit(113554) infosys(1) gssapi(2) krb5(2)}.</p>
<p>Another important feature of the API is that it is token based.
i.e., Calls to the API generate opaque octets that the application
must transport to its peer. This enables the API to be transport
independent.</p>
<img src="../images/gss.gif" alt=
"Multi-mechanism GSS-API" />
<p>Figure 5. A multi-mechanism GSS-API implementation</p>

<h3>Java GSS-API</h3>
<p>The Java API for the Generic Security Service was also defined
at the IETF and is documented in RFC 2853 [10]. Sun is pursuing the
standardization of this API under the Java Community Process (JCP)
[11] and plans to deliver a reference implementation with Merlin.
Because the JCP is merely endorsing this externally defined API,
the IETF assigned package namespace "org.ietf.jgss" will be
retained in Merlin.</p>
<p>Sun's implementation of Java GSS-API, will initially ship with
support for the Kerberos V5 mechanism only. Kerberos V5 mechanism
support is mandatory for all Java GSS-API implementations in Java
SE, although they are free to support additional mechanisms. In a
future release, a Service Provider Interface (SPI) will be added so
that new mechanisms can be configured statically or even at
runtime. Even now the reference implementation in Merlin will be
modular and support a private provider SPI that will be converted
to public when standardized.</p>
<p>The Java GSS-API framework itself is quite thin, and all
security related functionality is delegated to components obtained
from the underlying mechanisms. The GSSManager class is aware of
all mechanism providers installed and is responsible for invoking
them to obtain these components.</p>
<p>The implementation of the default GSSManager that will ship with
Java SE is obtained as follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();
</pre>
<p>The GSSManager can be used to configure new providers and to
list all mechanisms already present. The GSSManager also serves as
a factory class for three important interfaces: GSSName,
GSSCredential, and GSSContext. These interfaces are described below
with the methods to instantiate their implementations. For a
complete API specification, readers are referred to [9] and
[11].</p>
<p>Most calls to Java GSS-API throw a GSSException that encapsulate
problems that occur both within the GSS-API framework, and within
the mechanism providers.</p>
<h3>The GSSName Interface</h3>
<p>This interface represents an entity for the purposes of Java
GSS-API. An implementation of this interface is instantiated as
follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
GSSName GSSManager.createName(String name, Oid nameType)
    throws GSSException
</pre>
<p>For Example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
GSSName clientName = manager.createName("duke", GSSName.NT_USER_NAME);
</pre>
<p>This call returns a GSSName that represents the user principal
"duke" at a mechanism independent level. Internally, it is assumed
that each supported mechanism will map the generic representation
of the user to a more mechanism specific form. For instance a
Kerberos V5 mechanism provider might map this name to
duke@EXAMPLE.COM where EXAMPLE.COM is the local Kerberos realm.
Similarly, a public key based mechanism provider might map this
name to an X.509 Distinguished Name.</p>
<p>If we were referring to a principal that was not a user, but
some sort of service, we would indicate that to the Java GSS-API
call so that the mechanism knows to interpret it differently.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
GSSName serverName = manager.createName("nfs@bar.example.com",
                                         GSSName.NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE);
</pre>
<p>The Kerberos V5 mechanism would map this name to the Kerberos
specific form nfs/bar.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM where EXAMPLE.COM is
the realm of the principal. This principal represents the service
nfs running on the host machine bar.example.com.</p>
<p>Sun's implementation of the GSSName interface is a container
class. The container class lazily asks the individual providers to
perform their mapping when their mechanism is used and then stores
each mapped element in a set of principals. In this respect an
implementation of GSSName is similar to the principal set stored in
a Subject. It may even contain the same elements that are in a
Subject's principal set, but its use is restricted to the context
of Java GSS-API.</p>
<p>The name element stored by the Sun Kerberos V5 provider is an
instance of a subclass of
javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal.</p>
<h3>The GSSCredential Interface</h3>
<p>This interface encapsulates the credentials owned by one entity.
Like the GSSName, this interface too is a multi-mechanism
container.</p>
<p>Its implementation is instantiated as follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
GSSCredential createCredential(GSSName name,
                               int lifetime,
                               Oid[] desiredMechs,
                               int usage)

    throws GSSException
</pre>
<p>Here is an example of this call on the client side:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
GSSCredential clientCreds =
               manager.createCredential(clientName,
                                        8*3600,
                                        desiredMechs,
                                        GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY);
</pre>
<p>The GSSManager invokes the providers of the mechanisms listed in
the desiredMechs for credentials that belong to the GSSName
clientName. Additionally, it imposes the restriction that the
credential must be the kind that can initiate outbound requests
(i.e., a client credential), and requests a lifetime of 8 hours for
it. The returned object contains elements from a subset of
desiredMechs that had some credential available to satisfy this
criteria. The element stored by the Kerberos V5 mechanism is an
instance of a subclass of
javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosTicket containing a TGT that
belongs to the user.</p>
<p>Credential acquisition on the server side occurs as follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
GSSCredential serverCreds =
          manager.createCredential(serverName,
                                   GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME,
                                   desiredMechs,
                                   GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY);
</pre>
<p>The behavior is similar to the client case, except that the kind
of credential requested is one that can accept incoming requests
(i.e., a server credential). Moreover, servers are typically long
lived and like to request a longer lifetime for the credentials
such as the INDEFINITE_LIFETIME shown here. The Kerberos V5
mechanism element stored is an instance of a subclass of
javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosKey containing the secret key
of the server.</p>
<p>This step can be an expensive one, and applications generally
acquire a reference at initialization time to all the credentials
they expect to use during their lifetime.</p>
<h3>The GSSContext Interface</h3>
<p>The GSSContext is an interface whose implementation provides
security services to the two peers.</p>
<p>On the client side a GSSContext implementation is obtained with
the following API call:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
GSSContext GSSManager.createContext(GSSName peer,
                                    Oid mech,
                                    GSSCredential clientCreds,
                                    int lifetime)
    throws GSSException
</pre>
<p>This returns an initialized security context that is aware of
the peer that it must communicate with and the mechanism that it
must use to do so. The client's credentials are necessary to
authenticate to the peer.</p>
<p>On the server side the GSSContext is obtained as follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
GSSContext GSSManager.createContext(GSSCredential serverCreds)
    throws GSSException
</pre>
<p>This returns an initialized security context on the acceptor's
side. At this point it does not know the name of the peer (client)
that will send a context establishment request or even the
underlying mechanism that will be used. However, if the incoming
request is not for service principal represented by the credentials
serverCreds, or the underlying mechanism requested by the client
side does not have a credential element in serverCreds, then the
request will fail.</p>
<p>Before the GSSContext can be used for its security services it
has to be established with an exchange of tokens between the two
peers. Each call to the context establishment methods will generate
an opaque token that the application must somehow send to its peer
using a communication channel of its choice.</p>
<p>The client uses the following API call to establish the
context:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
byte[] GSSContext.initSecContext(byte[] inToken,
                                 int offset,
                                 int len)

   throws GSSException
</pre>
<p>The server uses the following call:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
byte[] acceptSecContext(byte[] inToken,
                        int offset,
                        int len)

   throws GSSException
</pre>
<p>These two methods are complementary and the input accepted by
one is the output generated by the other. The first token is
generated when the client calls initSecContext for the first time.
The arguments to this method are ignored during that call. The last
token generated depends on the particulars of the security
mechanism being used and the properties of the context being
established.</p>
<p>The number of round trips of GSS-API tokens required to
authenticate the peers varies from mechanism to mechanism and also
varies with characteristics such as whether mutual authentication
or one-way authentication is desired. Thus each side of the
application must continue to call the context establishment methods
in a loop until the process is complete.</p>
<p>In the case of the Kerberos V5 mechanism, there is no more than
one round trip of tokens during context establishment. The client
first sends a token generated by its initSecContext() containing
the Kerberos AP-REQ message [2]. In order to generate the AP-REQ
message, the Kerberos provider obtains a service ticket for the
target server using the client's TGT. The service ticket is
encrypted with the server's long-term secret key and is
encapsulated as part of the AP-REQ message. After the server
receives this token, it is passed to the acceptSecContext() method
which decrypts the service ticket and authenticates the client. If
mutual authentication was not requested, both the client and server
side contexts would be established, and the server side
acceptSecContext() would generate no output.</p>
<p>However, if mutual authentication were enabled, then the
server's acceptSecContext() would generate an output token
containing the Kerberos AP-REP [2] message. This token would need
to be sent back to the client for processing by its
initSecContext(), before the client side context is
established.</p>
<p>Note that when a GSSContext is initialized on the client side,
it is clear what underlying mechanism needs to be used. The Java
GSS-API framework can obtain a context implementation from the
appropriate mechanism provider. Thereafter, all calls made to the
GSSContext object are delegated to the mechanism's context
implementation. On the server side, the mechanism to use is not
decided until the first token from the client side arrives.</p>
<p>Here is a class showing how the client side of an application
would be coded. This is the ClientAction class that was executed
using the doAs method in Figure 3:</p>

</pre>
<h3>Message Protection</h3>
<p>Once the security context is established, it can be used for
message protection. Java GSS-API provides both message integrity
and message confidentiality. The two calls that enable this are as
follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
byte[] GSSContext.wrap(byte[] clearText,
                       int offset,
                       int len,
                       MessageProp properties)
    throws GSSException
</pre>
and
<pre class="codeblock">
byte[] unwrap(byte[] inToken,
              int offset,
              int len,
              MessageProp properties)
    throws GSSException
</pre>
<p>The wrap method is used to encapsulate a cleartext message in a
token such that it is integrity protected. Optionally, the message
can also be encrypted by requesting this through a properties
object. The wrap method returns an opaque token that the caller
sends to its peer. The original cleartext is returned by the peer's
unwrap method when the token is passed to it. The properties object
on the unwrap side returns information about whether the message
was simply integrity protected or whether it was encrypted as well.
It also contains sequencing and duplicate token warnings.</p>
<h3>Credential Delegation</h3>
<p>Java GSS-API allows the client to securely delegate its
credentials to the server, such that the server can initiate other
security contexts on behalf of the client. This feature is useful
for single sign-on in a multi-tier environment.</p>
<img src="../images/deleg.gif" alt=
"Credential delegation in a multi-tier environment" />
<p>Figure 8. Credential Delegation</p>

<p>The client requests credential delegation prior to making the
first call to initSecContext():</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
void GSSContext.requestCredDeleg(boolean state)
    throws GSSException
</pre>
by setting state to true.
<p>The server receives the delegated credential after context
establishment:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
GSSCredential GSSContext.getDelegCred() throws GSSException
</pre>
<p>The server can then pass this GSSCredential to
GSSManager.createContext() pretending to be the client.</p>
<p>In the case of the Kerberos V5 mechanism, the delegated
credential is a forwarded TGT that is encapsulated as part of the
first token sent from the client to the server. Using this TGT, the
server can obtain a service ticket on behalf of the client for any
other service.</p>
<h2>DEFAULT CREDENTIAL ACQUISITION
MODEL</h2>
<p>Previously we discussed how an application uses the
GSSManager.createCredential() method to populate a GSSCredential
object with mechanism specific credentials.The next two
sub-sections will focus on how Java GSS-API mechanisms obtain these
credentials. The mechanisms do not themselves perform a user login.
Instead, the login is performed prior to using Java GSS-API and the
credentials are assumed to be stored in some cache that the
mechanism provider is aware of. The GSSManager.createCredential()
method merely obtains references to those credentials and returns
them in a GSS-centric container, the GSSCredential.</p>
<p>In the Java 2 platform we impose the restriction that the
credentials cache that Java GSS-API mechanism providers use to
obtain these elements must exclusively be the public and private
credential sets in the Subject that is on the current access
control context.</p>
<p>This model has the advantage that credential management is
simple and predictable from the application's point of view. An
application, given the right permissions, can purge the credentials
in the Subject or renew them using standard Java API's. If it
purged the credentials, it would be sure that the Java GSS-API
mechanism would fail, or if it renewed a time based credential it
would be sure that the mechanism would succeed.</p>
<p>Here is the sequence of events relevant to credential
acquisition when the Kerberos V5 mechanism is used by the client
application in Figures 3 and 6:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application invokes a JAAS login, which in turn invokes the
configured Krb5LoginModule</li>
<li>Krb5LoginModule obtains a TGT (KerberosTicket) for the user
either from the KDC or from an existing ticket cache, and stores
this TGT in the private credentials set of a Subject</li>
<li>The application retrieves the populated Subject, then calls
Subject.doAs/doAsPrivileged which places this Subject on the access
control context of the thread executing ClientAction</li>
<li>ClientAction calls the GSSManager.createCredential method,
passing it the Kerberos V5 OID in desiredMechs.</li>
<li>GSSManager.createCredential invokes the Kerberos V5 GSS-API
provider, asking for a Kerberos credential for initiating security
contexts.</li>
<li>The Kerberos provider obtains the Subject from the current
access control context, and searches through its private credential
set for a valid KerberosTicket that represents the TGT for the
user.</li>
<li>The KerberosTicket is returned to the GSSManager which stores
it in a GSSCredential container instance to be returned to the
caller.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the server side, when the Kerberos login is successful in
step 2, Krb5LoginModule stores the KerberosKey for the server in
the Subject in addition to the KerberosTicket. Later on the
KerberosKey is retrieved in steps 5 through 7 and used to decrypt
the service ticket that the client sends.</p>
<h2>EXCEPTIONS TO THE MODEL</h2>
<p>The default credential acquisition model for Java GSS-API
requires credentials to be present in the current Subject.
Typically, the credentials are placed there after a JAAS login by
the application.</p>
<p>There might be cases where an application wishes to use Kerberos
credentials from outside the Subject. It is recommended that such
credentials be read as part of the initial JAAS login, either by
configuring Krb5LoginModule to read them, or by writing a custom
login module that reads them. However, some applications might have
constrains that either prevent them from using JAAS prior to
calling Java GSS-API, or force them to use some Kerberos mechanism
provider that does not retrieve credentials from the current
Subject.</p>
<p>In order to accommodate such cases while still retaining the
standard model for others, the system property
<i>javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly</i> was added. This
system property serves as a boolean where a value of true requires
that the standard credential acquisition model be followed, and a
value of false permits the provider to use any cache of it choice.
The default value of this property (when it is not set) will be
assumed to be true.</p>
<p>If there is no valid Kerberos credential in the current Subject,
and this property is true, then the Kerberos mechanism throws a
GSSException. Setting this property to false does not necessarily
mean that the provider has to use a cache other than the current
Subject, it only gives the provider the latitude to do so if it
wishes.</p>
<p>The Sun provider for the Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism always
obtains credentials from a Subject. If there are no valid
credentials in the current Subject, and this property is set to
false, then the provider attempts to obtain new credentials from a
temporary Subject by invoking a JAAS login itself. It uses the text
callback handler for input/output with the user, and the JAAS
configuration entry identified by"other" for the list of modules
and options to use.<a class="footnote" href="#a2">Footnote 2</a> 
</p>
<p>The Sun provider for the Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism 
assumes that one of these modules will
be a Kerberos login module. It is possible to configure the modules
listed under "other" to read a pre-existing cache so that the user
is not unexpectedly prompted for a password in the middle of a Java
GSS-API call. The new Subject that is populated by this login is
discarded by the Kerberos GSS-API mechanism just as soon as the
required credentials are retrieved from it.</p>
<h2>WEB-BROWSER INTEGRATION</h2>
<p>An important class of applications that should be able to
capitalize on Java single sign-on are applets. For this discussion
we assume that the browser JRE has all the required packages or the
Java plugin is used with a Merlin JRE installed by the user.</p>
<p>One complication in using applets arises mostly out of the fact
that before an applet can use Java GSS-API, it must perform a JAAS
login. The main problems with this are (a) an increase in the
effort required on the part of the applet developer (b)unnecessary
repeated login by the same user each time he or she starts an
applet.</p>
<p>A good model to solve this problem would be to have the browser
(or the Java plugin) perform a JAAS login once at startup. This
would provide a Subject that could always be associated with the
access control context whenever any Java code was run. As a result,
the applet code would not need to perform a JAAS login prior to
using Java GSS-API, and the user login would occur just once.</p>
<p>In the absence of this login functionality in the browser (or
Java plugin), applets can still avoid having to perform a JAAS
login themselves. To do so, the applets would have to set the
<i>javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly</i> system property to
false and use a GSS-API mechanism provider that is capable of
obtaining credentials from sources other than current Subject. When
using a Sun JRE with a Sun Kerberos GSS-API provider, expect the
mechanism to perform a JAAS login to obtain new credentials as
explained in the previous section. The applet deployer would only
need to ensure that the appropriate modules and options are listed
in the entry "other" in the JAAS configuration used by the JRE.
This saves the applet developer from calling into JAAS API's
directly, but it does not stop the repeated JAAS login that might
happen with each applet the user runs. However, by configuring the
login modules to read a pre-existing native cache, the deployer can
both hide the login from the user, and minimize the overhead in the
multiple logins. (See how this is done for the JAAS configuration
entry "SampleClient" in Figure 1.)</p>
<h2>SECURITY RISKS</h2>
<p>The convenience of single sign-on also introduces new risks.
What happens if a malicious user gains access to your unattended
desktop from where he or she can start applets as you? What happens
if malicious applets sign on as you to services that they are not
supposed to?</p>
<p>For the former, we have no solution but to caution you against
leaving your workstation unlocked! For the latter, we have many
authorizations checks in place.</p>
<p>To illustrate some details of the permissions model consider an
example where your browser has performed a JAAS login at startup
time and associated a Subject with all applets that run in it.</p>
<p>The Subject is protected from rogue applets by means of the
javax.security.auth.AuthPermission class. This permission is
checked whenever code tries to obtain a reference to the Subject
associated with any access control context.</p>
<p>Even if an applet were given access to a Subject, it needs a
javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission to actually read
the sensitive private credentials stored in it.</p>
<p>Other kinds of checks are to be done by Java GSS-API mechanism
providers as they read credentials and establish security contexts
on behalf of the credential's owner. In order to support the
Kerberos V5 mechanism, two new permission classes have been added
with the package javax.security.auth.kerberos:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
ServicePermission(String servicePrinicipal, String action)
DelegationPermission(String principals)
</pre>
<p>As new GSS-API mechanisms are standardized for Java SE, more
packages will be added that contain relevant permission classes for
providers of those mechanisms.</p>
<p>The Kerberos GSS-API mechanism permission checks take place at
the following points in the program's execution:</p>
<h3>Credential Acquisition</h3>
<p>The GSSManager.createCredential() method obtains mechanism
specific credential elements from a cache such as the current
Subject and stores them in a GSSCredential container. Allowing
applets to acquire GSSCredential freely, even if they cannot use
them to do much, is undesirable. Doing so leaks information about
the existence of user and service principals. Thus, before an
application can acquire a GSSCredential with any Kerberos
credential elements in it, a ServicePermission check is made.</p>
<p>On the client side, a successful GSSCredential acquisition
implies that a TGT has been accessed from a cache. Thus the
following ServicePermission is checked:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
ServicePermission("krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM", "initiate");
</pre>
<p>The service principal krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM represents
the ticket granting service (TGS) in the Kerberos realm
EXAMPLE.COM, and the action "initiate" suggests that a ticket to
this service is being accessed. The TGS service principal will
always be used in this permission check at the time of client side
credential acquisition.</p>
<p>On the server side, a successful GSSCredential acquisition
implies that a secret key has been accessed from a cache. Thus the
following ServicePermission is checked:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
ServicePermission("nfs/bar.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM", "accept");
</pre>
<p>Here the service principal nfs/bar.example.com represents the
Kerberos service principal and the action "accept" suggests that
the secret key for this service is being requested.</p>
<h3>Context Establishment</h3>
<p>An applet that has permissions to contact a particular server,
say the LDAP server, must not instead contact a different server
such as the FTP server. Of course, the applet might be restricted
from doing so with the help of SocketPermission. However, it is
possible to use ServicePermission to restrict it from
authenticating using your identity, even if the network connection
was permitted.</p>
<p>When the Kerberos mechanism provider is about to initiate
context establishment it checks the ServicePermission:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
ServicePermission("ftp@EXAMPLE.COM", "initiate");
</pre>
<p>This check prevents unauthorized code from obtaining and using a
Kerberos service ticket for the principal ftp@EXAMPLE.COM.</p>
<p>Providing limited access to specific service principals using
this permission is still dangerous. Downloaded code is allowed to
communicate back with the host it originated from. A malicious
applet could send back the initial GSS-API output token that
contains a KerberosTicket encrypted in the target service
principal's long-term secret key, thus exposing it to an offline
dictionary attack. For this reason it is not advisable to grant any
"initiate" ServicePermission to code downloaded from untrusted
sites.</p>
<p>On the server side, the permission to use the secret key to
accept incoming security context establishment requests is already
checked during credential acquisition. Hence, no checks are made in
the context establishment stage.</p>
<h3>Credential Delegation</h3>
<p>An applet that has permission to establish a security context
with a server on your behalf also has the ability to request that
your credentials be delegated to that server. But not all servers
are trusted to the extent that your credentials can be delegated to
them. Thus, before a Kerberos provider obtains a delegated
credential to send to the peer, it checks the following
permission:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
DelegationPermission(" \"ftp@EXAMPLE.COM\" \"krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM\" ");
</pre>
<p>This permission allows the Kerberos service principal
ftp@EXAMPLE.COM to receive a forwarded TGT (represented by the
ticket granting service
krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM).<a class="footnote" href="#a3">Footnote 3</a></p>
<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>In this paper we have presented a framework to enable single
sign-on in Java. This requires sharing of credentials between JAAS
which does the initial authentication to obtain credentials, and
Java GSS-API which uses those credentials to communicate securely
over the wire. We have focused on Kerberos V5 as the underlying
security mechanism, but JAAS's stackable architecture and Java
GSS-API's multi-mechanism nature allow us to use any number of
different mechanisms simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Kerberos login module for JAAS is capable of reading native
caches so that users do not have to authenticate themselves beyond
desktop login on platforms that support Kerberos. Moreover, the
Kerberos V5 mechanism for Java GSS-API allows credentials to be
delegated which enables single sign-on in multi-tier
environments.</p>
<p>Finally, a number of permissions checks are shown to prevent the
unauthorized use of the single-sign on features provided by
Kerberos.</p>
