<h2>Subjects, Principals, Authentication, and Credentials</h2>
<p>To authorize access to resources, applications first need to
authenticate the source of the request. The JAAS framework defines
the term <b><i>subject</i></b> to represent the source of a
request. A subject may be any entity, such as a person or service.
A subject is represented by the <a href=
"../../../../../api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html"><code>javax.security.auth.Subject</code></a>
class.</p>
<p><b><i>Authentication</i></b> represents the process by which the
identity of a subject is verified, and must be performed in a
secure fashion; otherwise a perpetrator may impersonate others to
gain access to a system. Authentication typically involves the
subject demonstrating some form of evidence to prove its identity.
Such evidence may be information only the subject would likely know
or have (such as a password or fingerprint), or it may be
information only the subject could produce (such as signed data
using a private key).</p>
<p>Once authenticated, a Subject is populated with associated
identities, or <b><i>Principals</i></b> (of type <a href=
"../../../../../api/java/security/Principal.html"><code>java.security.Principal</code></a>).
A Subject may have many Principals. For example, a person may have
a name Principal ("John Doe") and an SSN Principal ("123-45-6789"),
which distinguish it from other Subjects.</p>
<p>In addition to associated Principals, a Subject may own
security-related attributes, which are referred to as
<b><i>credentials</i></b>. A credential may contain information
used to authenticate the subject to new services. Such credentials
include passwords, Kerberos tickets, and public key certificates.
Credentials might also contain data that simply enables the subject
to perform certain activities. Cryptographic keys, for example,
represent credentials that enable the subject to sign or encrypt
data. Public and private credential classes are not part of the
core JAAS class library. Any class, therefore, can represent a
credential.</p>
