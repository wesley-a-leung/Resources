<h1>Annotations</h1>

<!-- Body text begins here -->
Many APIs require a fair amount of boilerplate code. For example,
in order to write a JAX-RPC web service, you must provide a paired
interface and implementation. This boilerplate could be generated
automatically by a tool if the program were &ldquo;decorated&rdquo;
with annotations indicating which methods were remotely accessible.
<p>Other APIs require &ldquo;side files&rdquo; to be maintained in
parallel with programs. For example JavaBeans requires a <a href=
"../../../api/java/beans/BeanInfo.html"><code>BeanInfo</code></a>
class to be maintained in parallel with a bean, and Enterprise
JavaBeans (EJB) requires a <i>deployment descriptor</i>. It would
be more convenient and less error-prone if the information in these
side files were maintained as annotations in the program
itself.</p>

<p>The Java platform has always had various ad hoc annotation
mechanisms. For example the <code>transient</code> modifier is an
ad hoc annotation indicating that a field should be ignored by the
serialization subsystem, and the <code>@deprecated</code> javadoc
tag is an ad hoc annotation indicating that the method should no
longer be used. The platform has a general
purpose annotation (also known as <i>metadata</i>) facility that
permits you to define and use your own annotation types. The
facility consists of a syntax for declaring annotation types, a
syntax for annotating declarations, APIs for reading annotations, a
class file representation for annotations, and annotation processing support provided by the <code><a href="../../tools/index.html#javac">javac</a></code> tool.</p>

<p>Annotations do not directly affect program semantics, but they
do affect the way programs are treated by tools and libraries,
which can in turn affect the semantics of the running program.
Annotations can be read from source files, class files, or
reflectively at run time.</p>

<p>Annotations complement javadoc tags. In general, if the markup
is intended to affect or produce documentation, it should probably
be a javadoc tag; otherwise, it should be an annotation.</p>

<p>Typical application programmers will never have to define an
annotation type, but it is not hard to do so. Annotation type
declarations are similar to normal interface declarations. An
at-sign (<code>@</code>) precedes the <code>interface</code>
keyword. Each method declaration defines an <i>element</i> of the
annotation type. Method declarations must not have any parameters
or a <code>throws</code> clause. Return types are restricted to
primitives, <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/String.html"><code>String</code></a>,
<a href="../../../api/java/lang/Class.html"><code>Class</code></a>,
<a href="enums.html">enums</a>, annotations, and arrays of the
preceding types. Methods can have <i>default values</i>. Here is an
example annotation type declaration:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
/**
 * Describes the Request-For-Enhancement(RFE) that led
 * to the presence of the annotated API element.
 */
public @interface RequestForEnhancement {
    int    id();
    String synopsis();
    String engineer() default "[unassigned]"; 
    String date()    default "[unimplemented]"; 
}
</pre>
<p>Once an annotation type is defined, you can use it to annotate
declarations. An annotation is a special kind of modifier, and can
be used anywhere that other modifiers (such as <code>public</code>,
<code>static</code>, or <code>final</code>) can be used. By
convention, annotations precede other modifiers. Annotations
consist of an at-sign (<code>@</code>) followed by an annotation
type and a parenthesized list of element-value pairs. The values
must be compile-time constants. Here is a method declaration with
an annotation corresponding to the annotation type declared
above:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
@RequestForEnhancement(
    id       = 2868724,
    synopsis = "Enable time-travel",
    engineer = "Mr. Peabody",
    date     = "4/1/3007"
)
public static void travelThroughTime(Date destination) { ... }
</pre>
<p>An annotation type with no elements is termed a <i>marker</i>
annotation type, for example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
/**
 * Indicates that the specification of the annotated API element
 * is preliminary and subject to change.
 */
public @interface Preliminary { }
</pre>
<p>It is permissible to omit the parentheses in marker annotations,
as shown below:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
@Preliminary public class TimeTravel { ... }
</pre>
<p>In annotations with a single element, the element should be
named <code>value</code>, as shown below:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
/**
 * Associates a copyright notice with the annotated API element.
 */
public @interface Copyright {
    String <strong>value</strong>();
}
</pre>
<p>It is permissible to omit the element name and equals sign
(<code>=</code>) in a single-element annotation whose element name
is <code>value</code>, as shown below:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
@Copyright("2002 Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems")
public class OscillationOverthruster { ... }
</pre>
<p>To tie it all together, we'll build a simple annotation-based
test framework. First we need a marker annotation type to indicate
that a method is a test method, and should be run by the testing
tool:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
import java.lang.annotation.*;

/**
 * Indicates that the annotated method is a test method.
 * This annotation should be used only on parameterless static methods.
 */
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public <strong>@interface Test</strong> { }
</pre>
<p>Note that the annotation type declaration is itself annotated.
Such annotations are called <i>meta-annotations</i>. The first
(<code>@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)</code>) indicates that
annotations with this type are to be retained by the VM so they can
be read reflectively at run-time. The second
(<code>@Target(ElementType.METHOD)</code>) indicates that this
annotation type can be used to annotate only method
declarations.</p>
<p>Here is a sample program, some of whose methods are annotated
with the above interface:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
public class Foo {
    <strong>@Test</strong> public static void m1() { }
    public static void m2() { }
    <strong>@Test</strong> public static void m3() {
        throw new RuntimeException("Boom");
    }
    public static void m4() { }
    <strong>@Test</strong> public static void m5() { }
    public static void m6() { }
    <strong>@Test</strong> public static void m7() {
        throw new RuntimeException("Crash");
    }
    public static void m8() { }
}
</pre>
<p>Here is the testing tool:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
import java.lang.reflect.*;

public class RunTests {
   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
      int passed = 0, failed = 0;
      for (Method m : Class.forName(args[0]).getMethods()) {
         if (<strong>m.isAnnotationPresent(Test.class)</strong>) {
            try {
               m.invoke(null);
               passed++;
            } catch (Throwable ex) {
               System.out.printf("Test %s failed: %s %n", m, ex.getCause());
               failed++;
            }
         }
      }
      System.out.printf("Passed: %d, Failed %d%n", passed, failed);
   }
}
</pre>
<p>The tool takes a class name as a command line argument and
iterates over all the methods of the named class attempting to
invoke each method that is annotated with the <code>Test</code>
annotation type (defined above). The reflective query to find out
if a method has a <code>Test</code> annotation is highlighted in
green. If a test method invocation throws an exception, the test is
deemed to have failed, and a failure report is printed. Finally, a
summary is printed showing the number of tests that passed and
failed. Here is how it looks when you run the testing tool on the
<code>Foo</code> program (above):</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ java RunTests Foo
Test public static void Foo.m3() failed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Boom 
Test public static void Foo.m7() failed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Crash 
Passed: 2, Failed 2
</pre>
While this testing tool is clearly a toy, it demonstrates the power
of annotations and could easily be extended to overcome its
limitations. <!-- Body text ends here -->
