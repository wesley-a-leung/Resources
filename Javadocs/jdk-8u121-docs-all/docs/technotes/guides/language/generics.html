<h1>Generics</h1>
<br />
<!-- Body text begins here -->
<p>When you take an element out of a <code>Collection</code>, you
must cast it to the type of element that is stored in the
collection. Besides being inconvenient, this is unsafe. The
compiler does not check that your cast is the same as the
collection's type, so the cast can fail at run time.</p>
<p>Generics provides a way for you to communicate the type of a
collection to the compiler, so that it can be checked. Once the
compiler knows the element type of the collection, the compiler can
check that you have used the collection consistently and can insert
the correct casts on values being taken out of the collection.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example taken from the existing Collections
tutorial:</p>
<pre>
// Removes 4-letter words from c. <strong>Elements must be strings</strong>
static void expurgate(Collection c) {
    for (Iterator i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
      if (<strong>((String) i.next())</strong>.length() == 4)
        i.remove();
}
</pre>
<p>Here is the same example modified to use generics:</p>
<pre>
<a name="expurgate" id=
"expurgate">// Removes the 4-letter words from c</a>
static void expurgate(Collection<strong>&lt;String&gt;</strong> c) {
    for (Iterator<strong>&lt;String&gt;</strong> i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
      if (<strong>i.next()</strong>.length() == 4)
        i.remove();
}
</pre>
<p>When you see the code <code>&lt;Type&gt;</code>, read it as &quot;of
<code>Type</code>&quot;; the declaration above reads as
&quot;<code>Collection</code> of <code>String c</code>.&quot; The code
using generics is clearer and safer. We have eliminated an unsafe
cast and a number of extra parentheses. More importantly, we have
moved part of the specification of the method from a comment to its
signature, so the compiler can verify at compile time that the type
constraints are not violated at run time. Because the program
compiles without warnings, we can state with certainty that it will
not throw a <code>ClassCastException</code> at run time. The net
effect of using generics, especially in large programs, is improved
readability and robustness.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Generics Specification Lead Gilad Bracha, when we
declare <code>c</code> to be of type
<code>Collection&lt;String&gt;</code>, this tells us something
about the variable <code>c</code> that holds true wherever and
whenever it is used, and the compiler guarantees it (assuming the
program compiles without warnings). A cast, on the other hand,
tells us something the programmer thinks is true at a single point
in the code, and the VM checks whether the programmer is right only
at run time.</p>
<p>While the primary use of generics is collections, there are many
other uses. "Holder classes," such as <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html"><code>WeakReference</code></a>
and <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html"><code>ThreadLocal</code></a>,
have all been <i>generified</i>, that is, they have been
retrofitted to make use of generics. More surprisingly, class
<a href="../../../api/java/lang/Class.html"><code>Class</code></a>
has been generified. Class literals now function as <i>type
tokens</i>, providing both run-time and compile-time type
information. This enables a style of static factories exemplified
by the <code>getAnnotation</code> method in the new <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/reflect/AnnotatedElement.html"><code>AnnotatedElement</code></a>
interface:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;T extends Annotation&gt; T getAnnotation(Class&lt;T&gt; annotationType); 
</pre>
This is a <i>generic method</i>. It infers the value of its <i>type
parameter</i> <code>T</code> from its argument, and returns an
appropriate instance of <code>T</code>, as illustrated by the
following snippet:
<pre>
    Author a = Othello.class.getAnnotation(Author.class);
</pre>
Prior to generics, you would have had to cast the result to
<code>Author</code>. Also you would have had no way to make the
compiler check that the actual parameter represented a subclass of
<code>Annotation</code>.
<p>Generics are implemented by <i>type erasure</i>: generic type
information is present only at compile time, after which it is
<i>erased</i> by the compiler. The main advantage of this approach
is that it provides total interoperability between generic code and
legacy code that uses non-parameterized types (which are
technically known as <i>raw</i> types). The main disadvantages are
that parameter type information is not available at run time, and
that automatically generated casts may fail when interoperating
with ill-behaved legacy code. There is, however, a way to achieve
guaranteed run-time type safety for generic collections even when
interoperating with ill-behaved legacy code.</p>
<p>The <code>java.util.Collections</code> class has been outfitted
with wrapper classes that provide guaranteed run-time type safety.
They are similar in structure to the synchronized and unmodifiable
wrappers. These "checked collection wrappers" are very useful for
debugging. Suppose you have a set of strings, <code>s</code>, into
which some legacy code is mysteriously inserting an integer.
Without the wrapper, you will not find out about the problem until
you read the problem element from the set, and an automatically
generated cast to <code>String</code> fails. At this point, it is
too late to determine the source of the problem. If, however, you
replace the declaration:</p>
<pre>
    Set&lt;String&gt; s = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;();
</pre>
with this declaration:
<pre>
    Set&lt;String&gt; s = Collections.checkedSet(new HashSet&lt;String&gt;(), String.class);
</pre>
the collection will throw a <code>ClassCastException</code> at the
point where the legacy code attempts to insert the integer. The
resulting stack trace will allow you to diagnose and repair the
problem.
<p>You should use generics everywhere you can. The extra effort in
generifying code is well worth the gains in clarity and type
safety. It is straightforward to use a generic library, but it
requires some expertise to write a generic library, or to generify
an existing library. There is one caveat: You may not use generics
(or any other Tiger features) if you intend to deploy the compiled
code on a pre-5.0 virtual machine.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with C++'s <i>template</i> mechanism, you
might think that generics are similar, but the similarity is
superficial. Generics do not generate a new class for each
specialization, nor do they permit "template metaprogramming."</p>
<p>There is much more to learn about generics. See the <a href=
