<h1>Chapter 12: Synthesizing Sound</h1>
<p><a name="a121725" id="a121725"></a> Most programs that avail
themselves of the Java Sound API's MIDI package do so to synthesize
sound. The entire apparatus of MIDI files, events, sequences, and
sequencers, which was discussed in other chapters, nearly always
has the goal of eventually sending musical data to a synthesizer to
convert into audio. (Possible exceptions include programs that
convert MIDI into musical notation that can be read by a musician,
and programs that send messages to external MIDI-controlled devices
such as mixing consoles.)</p>
<p><a name="a121727" id="a121727"></a> The <code>Synthesizer</code>
interface is therefore fundamental to the MIDI package. This
chapter shows how to manipulate a synthesizer to play sound. Many
programs will simply use a sequencer to send MIDI file data to the
synthesizer, and won't need to invoke many <code>Synthesizer</code>
methods directly. However, it's possible to control a synthesizer
directly, without using sequencers or even <code>MidiMessage</code>
objects, as explained near the end of this chapter.</p>
<p><a name="a121729" id="a121729"></a> The synthesis architecture
might seem complex for readers who are unfamiliar with MIDI. Its
API includes three interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a121730" id=
"a121730"></a></li>
<li><code>Synthesizer</code> <a name="a121731" id=
"a121731"></a></li>
<li><code>MidiChannel</code> <a name="a121732" id=
"a121732"></a></li>
<li><code>Soundbank</code>
<p><a name="a121733" id="a121733"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
and four classes:
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><a name="a121734"></a></li>
<li><code>Instrument</code> <a name="a121735" id=
"a121735"></a></li>
<li><code>Patch</code> <a name="a121736" id="a121736"></a></li>
<li><code>SoundbankResource</code> <a name="a121737" id=
"a121737"></a></li>
<li><code>VoiceStatus</code>
<p><a name="a121739" id="a121739"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
As orientation for all this API, the next section explains some of
the basics of MIDI synthesis and how they're reflected in the Java
Sound API. (Also see the brief section "<a href=
"chapter8.html#a118862">Synthesizers</a>" under "<a href=
"chapter8.html#a118842">The Java Sound API's Representation of MIDI
Devices</a>" in Chapter 8, "<a href="chapter8.html">Overview of the
MIDI Package</a>.") Subsequent sections give a more detailed look
at the API. <a name="a121742" id="a121742"></a>
<h2>Understanding MIDI Synthesis</h2>
<p><a name="a121745" id="a121745"></a> How does a synthesizer
generate sound? Depending on its implementation, it may use one or
more sound-synthesis techniques. For example, many synthesizers use
wavetable synthesis. A wavetable synthesizer reads stored snippets
of audio from memory, playing them at different sample rates and
looping them to create notes of different pitches and durations.
For example, to synthesize the sound of a saxophone playing the
note C#a4 (MIDI note number 61), the synthesizer might access a very
short snippet from a recording of a saxophone playing the note
Middle C (MIDI note number 60), and then cycle repeatedly through
this snippet at a slightly faster sample rate than it was recorded
at, which creates a long note of a slightly higher pitch. Other
synthesizers use techniques such as frequency modulation (FM),
additive synthesis, or physical modeling, which don't make use of
stored audio but instead generate audio from scratch using
different algorithms.</p>
<a name="a121747" id="a121747"></a>
<h3>Instruments</h3>
<p><a name="a123181" id="a123181"></a> What all synthesis
techniques have in common is the ability to create many sorts of
sounds. Different algorithms, or different settings of parameters
within the same algorithm, create different-sounding results. An
<em>instrument</em> is a specification for synthesizing a certain
type of sound. That sound may emulate a traditional musical
instrument, such as a piano or violin; it may emulate some other
kind of sound source, for instance, a telephone or helicopter; or
it may emulate no "real-world" sound at all. A specification called
General MIDI defines a standard list of 128 instruments, but most
synthesizers allow other instruments as well. Many synthesizers
provide a collection of built-in instruments that are always
available for use; some synthesizers also support mechanisms for
loading additional instruments.</p>
<p><a name="a123190" id="a123190"></a> An instrument may be
vendor-specific&mdash;in other words, applicable to only one
synthesizer or several models from the same vendor. This
incompatibility results when two different synthesizers use
different sound-synthesis techniques, or different internal
algorithms and parameters even if the fundamental technique is the
same. Because the details of the synthesis technique are often
proprietary, incompatibility is common. The Java Sound API includes
ways to detect whether a given synthesizer supports a given
instrument.</p>
<p><a name="a121753" id="a121753"></a> An instrument can usually be
considered a preset; you don't have to know anything about the
details of the synthesis technique that produces its sound.
However, you can still vary aspects of its sound. Each Note On
message specifies the pitch and volume of an individual note. You
can also alter the sound through other MIDI commands such as
controller messages or system-exclusive messages.</p>
<a name="a121755" id="a121755"></a>
<h3>Channels</h3>
<p><a name="a121759" id="a121759"></a> Many synthesizers are
<em>multimbral</em> (sometimes called <em>polytimbral</em>),
meaning that they can play the notes of different instruments
simultaneously. (<em>Timbre</em> is the characteristic sound
quality that enables a listener to distinguish one kind of musical
instrument from other kinds.) Multimbral synthesizers can emulate
an entire ensemble of real-world instruments, instead of only one
instrument at a time. MIDI synthesizers normally implement this
feature by taking advantage of the different MIDI channels on which
the MIDI specification allows data to be transmitted. In this case,
the synthesizer is actually a collection of sound-generating units,
each emulating a different instrument and responding independently
to messages that are received on a different MIDI channel. Since
the MIDI specification provides only 16 channels, a typical MIDI
synthesizer can play up to 16 different instruments at once. The
synthesizer receives a stream of MIDI commands, many of which are
channel commands. (Channel commands are targeted to a particular
MIDI channel; for more information, see the MIDI specification.) If
the synthesizer is multitimbral, it routes each channel command to
the correct sound-generating unit, according to the channel number
indicated in the command.</p>
<p><a name="a121761" id="a121761"></a> In the Java Sound API, these
sound-generating units are instances of classes that implement the
<code>MidiChannel</code> interface. A <code>synthesizer</code>
object has at least one <code>MidiChannel</code> object. If the
synthesizer is multimbral, it has more than one, normally 16. Each
<code>MidiChannel</code> represents an independent sound-generating
unit.</p>
<p><a name="a121763" id="a121763"></a> Because a synthesizer's
<code>MidiChannel</code> objects are more or less independent, the
assignment of instruments to channels doesn't have to be unique.
For example, all 16 channels could be playing a piano timbre, as
though there were an ensemble of 16 pianos. Any grouping is
possible&mdash;for instance, channels 1, 5, and 8 could be playing
guitar sounds, while channels 2 and 3 play percussion and channel
12 has a bass timbre. The instrument being played on a given MIDI
channel can be changed dynamically; this is known as a <em>program
change</em>.</p>
<p><a name="a121765" id="a121765"></a> Even though most
synthesizers allow only 16 or fewer instruments to be active at a
given time, these instruments can generally be chosen from a much
larger selection and assigned to particular channels as
required.</p>
<a name="a121767" id="a121767"></a>
<h3>Soundbanks and Patches</h3>
<p><a name="a121769" id="a121769"></a> Instruments are organized
hierarchically in a synthesizer. As was mentioned in Chapter 8,
"<a href="chapter8.html">Overview of the MIDI Package</a>," the
instruments are arranged by bank number and program number. Banks
and programs can be thought of as rows and columns in a
two-dimensional table of instruments. A bank is a collection of
programs. The MIDI specification allows up to 128 programs in a
bank, and up to 128 banks. However, a particular synthesizer might
support only one bank, or a few banks, and might support fewer than
128 programs per bank.</p>
<p><a name="a121771" id="a121771"></a> In the Java Sound API,
there's a higher level to the hierarchy: a soundbank. Soundbanks
can contain up to 128 banks, each containing up to 128 instruments.
Some synthesizers can load an entire soundbank into memory.</p>
<p><a name="a121773" id="a121773"></a> To select an instrument from
the current soundbank, you specify a bank number and a program
number. The MIDI specification accomplishes this with two MIDI
commands: bank select and program change. In the Java Sound API,
the combination of a bank number and program number is encapsulated
in a <code>Patch</code> object. You change a MIDI channel's current
instrument by specifying a new patch. The patch can be considered
the two-dimensional index of the instruments in the current
soundbank.</p>
<p><a name="a121775" id="a121775"></a> You might be wondering if
soundbanks, too, are indexed numerically. The answer is no; the
MIDI specification does not provide for this. In the Java Sound
API, a <code>Soundbank</code> object can be obtained by reading a
soundbank file. If the soundbank is supported by the synthesizer,
its instruments can be loaded into the synthesizer individually as
desired, or all at once. Many synthesizers have a built-in or
default soundbank; the instruments contained in this soundbank are
always available to the synthesizer.</p>
<a name="a121777" id="a121777"></a>
<h3>Voices</h3>
<p><a name="a121779" id="a121779"></a> It's important to
distinguish between the number of <em>timbres</em> a synthesizer
can play simultaneously and the number of <em>notes</em> it can
play simultaneously. The former was described above under
"Channels." The ability to play multiple notes at once is referred
to as <em>polyphony</em>. Even a synthesizer that isn't
multitimbral can generally play more than one note at a time (all
having the same timbre, but different pitches). For example,
playing any chord, such as a G major triad or a B minor seventh
chord, requires polyphony. Any synthesizer that generates sound in
real time has a limitation on the number of notes it can synthesize
at once. In the Java Sound API, the synthesizer reports this
limitation through the <code>getMaxPolyphony</code> method.</p>
<p><a name="a121783" id="a121783"></a> A <em>voice</em> is a
succession of single notes, such as a melody that a person can
sing. Polyphony consists of multiple voices, such as the parts sung
by a choir. A 32-voice synthesizer, for example, can play 32 notes
simultaneously. (However, some MIDI literature uses the word
"voice" in a different sense, similar to the meaning of
"instrument" or "timbre.")</p>
<p><a name="a121785" id="a121785"></a> The process of assigning
incoming MIDI notes to specific voices is known as <em>voice
allocation</em>. A synthesizer maintains a list of voices, keeping
track of which ones are active (meaning that they currently have
notes sounding). When a note stops sounding, the voice becomes
inactive, meaning that it's now free to accept the next note-on
request that the synthesizer receives. An incoming stream of MIDI
commands can easily request more simultaneous notes than the
synthesizer is capable of generating. When all the synthesizer's
voices are active, how should the next Note On request be handled?
Synthesizers can implement different strategies: the most recently
requested note can be ignored; or it can be played by discontinuing
another note, such as the least recently started one.</p>
<p><a name="a121787" id="a121787"></a> Although the MIDI
specification does not require it, a synthesizer can make public
the contents of each of its voices. The Java Sound API includes a
<code>VoiceStatus</code> class for this purpose.</p>
<p><a name="a121788" id="a121788"></a> A <code>VoiceStatus</code>
reports on the voice's current active or inactive status, MIDI
channel, bank and program number, MIDI note number, and MIDI
volume.</p>
<p><a name="a121790" id="a121790"></a> With this background, let's
examine the specifics of the Java Sound API for synthesis.</p>
<a name="a121793" id="a121793"></a>
<h2>Managing Instruments and Soundbanks</h2>
<p><a name="a121795" id="a121795"></a> In many cases, a program can
make use of a <code>Synthesizer</code> object without explicitly
invoking almost any of the synthesis API. For example, suppose
you're playing a standard MIDI file. You load it into a
<code>Sequence</code> object, which you play by having a sequencer
send the data to the default synthesizer. The data in the sequence
controls the synthesizer as intended, playing all the right notes
at the right times.</p>
<p><a name="a121797" id="a121797"></a> However, there are cases
when this simple scenario is inadequate. The sequence contains the
right music, but the instruments sound all wrong! This unfortunate
situation probably arose because the creator of the MIDI file had
different instruments in mind than the ones that are currently
loaded into the synthesizer.</p>
<p><a name="a123339" id="a123339"></a> The MIDI 1.0 Specification
provides for bank-select and program-change commands, which affect
which instrument is currently playing on each MIDI channel.
However, the specification does not define what instrument should
reside in each patch location (bank and program number). The more
recent General MIDI specification addresses this problem by
defining a bank containing 128 programs that correspond to specific
instrument sounds. A General MIDI synthesizer uses 128 instruments
that match this specified set. Different General MIDI synthesizers
can sound quite different, even when playing what's supposed to be
the same instrument. However, a MIDI file should for the most part
sound similar (even if not identical), no matter which General MIDI
synthesizer is playing it.</p>
<p><a name="a123341" id="a123341"></a> Nonetheless, not all
creators of MIDI files want to be limited to the set of 128 timbres
defined by General MIDI. This section shows how to change the
instruments from the default set that the synthesizer comes with.
(If there is no default, meaning that no instruments are loaded
when you access the synthesizer, you'll have to use this API to
start with in any case.)</p>
<a name="a121803" id="a121803"></a>
<h3>Learning What Instruments Are Loaded</h3>
<p><a name="a121805" id="a121805"></a> To learn whether the
instruments currently loaded into the synthesizer are the ones you
want, you can invoke this <code>Synthesizer</code> method:</p>
<pre>
Instrument[] getLoadedInstruments() 
</pre>
and iterate over the returned array to see exactly which
instruments are currently loaded. Most likely, you would display
the instruments' names in the user interface (using the
<code>getName</code> method of <code>Instrument</code>), and let
the user decide whether to use those instruments or load others.
The <code>Instrument</code> API includes a method that reports
which soundbank the instrument belongs to. The soundbank's name
might help your program or the user ascertain exactly what the
instrument is.
<p><a name="a123382" id="a123382"></a> This
<code>Synthesizer</code> method:</p>
<pre>
Soundbank getDefaultSoundbank() 
</pre>
gives you the default soundbank. The <code>Soundbank</code> API
includes methods to retrieve the soundbank's name, vendor, and
version number, by which the program or the user can verify the
bank's identity. However, you can't assume when you first get a
synthesizer that the instruments from the default soundbank have
been loaded into the synthesizer. For example, a synthesizer might
have a large assortment of built-in instruments available for use,
but because of its limited memory it might not load them
automatically. <a name="a121824" id="a121824"></a>
<h3>Loading Different Instruments</h3>
<p><a name="a122802" id="a122802"></a> The user might decide to
load instruments that are different from the current ones (or you
might make that decision programmatically). The following method
tells you which instruments come with the synthesizer (versus
having to be loaded from soundbank files):</p>
<pre>
Instrument[] getAvailableInstruments()
</pre>
You can load any of these instruments by invoking:
<pre>
boolean loadInstrument(Instrument instrument) 
</pre>
The instrument gets loaded into the synthesizer in the location
specified by the instrument's <code>Patch</code> object (which can
be retrieved using the <code>getPatch</code> method of
<code>Instrument</code>).
<p><a name="a121836" id="a121836"></a> To load instruments from
other soundbanks, first invoke <code>Synthesizer's</code>
<code>isSupportedSoundbank</code> method to make sure that the
soundbank is compatible with this synthesizer (if it isn't, you can
iterate over the system's synthesizers to try to find one that
supports the soundbank). You can then invoke one of these methods
to load instruments from the soundbank:</p>
<pre>
boolean loadAllInstruments(Soundbank soundbank) 
boolean loadInstruments(Soundbank soundbank, 
  Patch[] patchList) 
</pre>
As the names suggest, the first of these loads the entire set of
instruments from a given soundbank, and the second loads selected
instruments from the soundbank. You could also use
<code>Soundbank's</code> <code>getInstruments</code> method to
access all the instruments, then iterate over them and load
selected instruments one at a time using
<code>loadInstrument</code>.
<p><a name="a121843" id="a121843"></a> It's not necessary for all
the instruments you load to be from the same soundbank. You could
use <code>loadInstrument</code> or <code>loadInstruments</code> to
load certain instruments from one soundbank, another set from a
different soundbank, and so on.</p>
<p><a name="a121846" id="a121846"></a> Each instrument has its own
<code>Patch</code> object that specifies the location on the
synthesizer where the instrument should be loaded. The location is
defined by a bank number and a program number. There's no API to
change the location by changing the patch's bank or program
number.</p>
<p><a name="a121852" id="a121852"></a> However, it is possible to
load an instrument into a location other than the one specified by
its patch, using the following method of
<code>Synthesizer</code>:</p>
<pre>
boolean remapInstrument(Instrument from, Instrument to) 
</pre>
This method unloads its first argument from the synthesizer, and
places its second argument in whatever synthesizer patch location
had been occupied by the first argument. <a name="a121858" id=
"a121858"></a>
<h3>Unloading Instruments</h3>
<p><a name="a123434" id="a123434"></a> Loading an instrument into a
program location automatically unloads whatever instrument was
already at that location, if any. You can also explicitly unload
instruments without necessarily replacing them with new ones.
<code>Synthesizer</code> includes three unloading methods that
correspond to the three loading methods. If the synthesizer
receives a program-change message that selects a program location
where no instrument is currently loaded, there won't be any sound
from the MIDI channel on which the program-change message was
sent.</p>
<a name="a123435" id="a123435"></a>
<h3>Accessing Soundbank Resources</h3>
<p><a name="a123439" id="a123439"></a> Some synthesizers store
other information besides instruments in their soundbanks. For
example, a wavetable synthesizer stores audio samples that one or
more instruments can access. Because the samples might be shared by
multiple instruments, they're stored in the soundbank independently
of any instrument. Both the <code>Soundbank</code> interface and
the <code>Instrument</code> class provide a method call
<code>getSoundbankResources</code>, which returns a list of
<code>SoundbankResource</code> objects. The details of these
objects are specific to the synthesizer for which the soundbank is
designed. In the case of wavetable synthesis, a resource might be
an object that encapsulates a series of audio samples, taken from
one snippet of a sound recording. Synthesizers that use other
synthesis techniques might store other kinds of objects in the
synthesizer's <code>SoundbankResources</code> array.</p>
<a name="a123441" id="a123441"></a>
<h2>Querying the Synthesizer's Capabilities and Current State</h2>
<p><a name="a121873" id="a121873"></a> The <code>Synthesizer</code>
interface includes methods that return information about the
synthesizer's capabilities:</p>
<pre>
    public long getLatency()
    public int getMaxPolyphony()
</pre>
The latency measures the worst-case delay between the time a MIDI
message is delivered to the synthesizer and the time that the
synthesizer actually produces the corresponding result. For
example, it might take a synthesizer a few milliseconds to begin
generating audio after receiving a note-on event.
<p><a name="a121880" id="a121880"></a> The
<code>getMaxPolyphony</code> method indicates how many notes the
synthesizer can sound simultaneously, as discussed under "<a href=
"chapter12.html#a121777">Voices</a>" in the section "<a href=
"chapter12.html#a121742">Understanding MIDI Synthesis</a>" earlier
in this chapter. As mentioned in the same discussion, a synthesizer
can provide information about its voices. This is accomplished
through the following method:</p>
<pre>
public VoiceStatus[] getVoiceStatus()
</pre>
Each <code>VoiceStatus</code> in the returned array reports the
voice's current active or inactive status, MIDI channel, bank and
program number, MIDI note number, and MIDI volume. The array's
length should normally be the same number returned by
<code>getMaxPolyphony</code>. If the synthesizer isn't playing, all
its <code>VoiceStatus</code> objects have their active field set to
<code>false</code>.
<p><a name="a121886" id="a121886"></a> You can learn additional
information about the current status of a synthesizer by retrieving
its <code>MidiChannel</code> objects and querying their state. This
is discussed more in the next section.</p>
<a name="a121890" id="a121890"></a>
<h2>Using Channels</h2>
<p><a name="a121892" id="a121892"></a> Sometimes it's useful or
necessary to access a synthesizer's <code>MidiChannel</code>
objects directly. This section discusses such situations.</p>
<a name="a121894" id="a121894"></a>
<h3>Controlling the Synthesizer without Using a Sequencer</h3>
<p><a name="a121896" id="a121896"></a> When using a sequence, such
as one read from a MIDI file, you don't need to send MIDI commands
to the synthesizer yourself. Instead, you just load the sequence
into a sequencer, connect the sequencer to the synthesizer, and let
it run. The sequencer takes care of scheduling the events, and the
result is a predictable musical performance. This scenario works
fine when the desired music is known in advance, which is true when
it's read from a file.</p>
<p><a name="a121898" id="a121898"></a> In some situations, however,
the music is generated on the fly as it's playing. For example, the
user interface might display a musical keyboard or a guitar
fretboard and let the user play notes at will by clicking with the
mouse. As another example, an application might use a synthesizer
not to play music per se, but to generate sound effects in response
to the user's actions. This scenario is typical of games. As a
final example, the application might indeed be playing music that's
read from a file, but the user interface allows the user to
interact with the music, altering it dynamically. In all these
cases, the application sends commands directly to the synthesizer,
since the MIDI messages need to be delivered immediately, instead
of being scheduled for some determinate point in the future.</p>
<p><a name="a121900" id="a121900"></a> There are at least two ways
of sending a MIDI message to the synthesizer without using a
sequencer. The first is to construct a <code>MidiMessage</code> and
pass it to the synthesizer using the send method of
<code>Receiver</code>. For example, to produce a Middle C (MIDI
note number 60) on MIDI channel 5 (one-based) immediately, you
could do the following:</p>
<pre>
    ShortMessage myMsg = new ShortMessage();
    // Play the note Middle C (60) moderately loud
    // (velocity = 93)on channel 4 (zero-based).
    myMsg.setMessage(ShortMessage.NOTE_ON, 4, 60, 93); 
    Synthesizer synth = MidiSystem.getSynthesizer();
    Receiver synthRcvr = synth.getReceiver();
    synthRcvr.send(myMsg, -1); // -1 means no time stamp
</pre>
The second way is to bypass the message-passing layer (that is, the
<code>MidiMessage</code> and <code>Receiver</code> API) altogether,
and interact with the synthesizer's <code>MidiChannel</code>
objects directly. You first need to retrieve the synthesizer's
<code>MidiChannel</code> objects, using the following
<code>Synthesizer</code> method:
<pre>
public MidiChannel[] getChannels()
</pre>
after which you can invoke the desired <code>MidiChannel</code>
methods directly. This is a more immediate route than sending the
corresponding <code>MidiMessages</code> to the synthesizer's
<code>Receiver</code> and letting the synthesizer handle the
communication with its own <code>MidiChannels</code>. For example,
the code corresponding to the preceding example would be:
<pre>
    Synthesizer synth = MidiSystem.getSynthesizer();
    MidiChannel chan[] = synth.getChannels(); 
    // Check for null; maybe not all 16 channels exist.
    if (chan[4] != null) {
         chan[4].noteOn(60, 93); 
    }
</pre>
<a name="a121937" id="a121937"></a>
<h3>Getting a Channel's Current State</h3>
<p><a name="a121939" id="a121939"></a> The <code>MidiChannel</code>
interface provides methods that correspond one-to-one to each of
the "channel voice" or "channel mode" messages defined by the MIDI
specification. We saw one case with the use of the noteOn method in
the previous example. However, in addition to these canonical
methods, the Java Sound API's <code>MidiChannel</code> interface
adds some "get" methods to retrieve the value most recently set by
corresponding voice or mode "set" methods:</p>
<pre>
    int       getChannelPressure()
    int       getController(int controller)
    boolean   getMono()
    boolean   getOmni() 
    int       getPitchBend() 
    int       getPolyPressure(int noteNumber)
    int       getProgram()
</pre>
These methods might be useful for displaying channel state to the
user, or for deciding what values to send subsequently to the
channel. <a name="a121953" id="a121953"></a>
<h3>Muting and Soloing a Channel</h3>
<p><a name="a123492" id="a123492"></a> The Java Sound API adds the
notions of per-channel solo and mute, which are not required by the
MIDI specification. These are similar to the solo and mute on the
tracks of a MIDI sequence. (See "Muting or Soloing Individual
Tracks in the Sequence" in Chapter 11, "Playing, Recording, and
Editing MIDI Sequences.)"</p>
<p><a name="a123493" id="a123493"></a> If mute is on, this channel
will not sound, but other channels are unaffected. If solo is on,
this channel, and any other soloed channel, will sound (if it isn't
muted), but no other channels will sound. A channel that is both
soloed and muted will not sound. The <code>MidiChannel</code> API
includes four methods:</p>
<pre>
    boolean      getMute() 
    boolean      getSolo()
    void         setMute(boolean muteState) 
    void         setSolo(boolean soloState)
</pre>

<h2>Permission to Play Synthesized Sound</h2>
<p><a name="a123505" id="a123505"></a> The audio produced by any
installed MIDI synthesizer is typically routed through the
sampled-audio system. If your program doesn't have permission to
play audio, the synthesizer's sound won't be heard, and a security
exception will be thrown. For more information on audio
permissions, see "<a href="chapter3.html#a113223">Permission to Use
Audio Resources</a>" in Chapter 3, "<a href=
"chapter3.html">Accessing Audio System Resources</a>."</p>
