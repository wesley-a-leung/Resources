<h2><u>Notes</u></h2>
<ol>
<li>The <code>Port</code> class was not available on all platforms
before JDK 5.0.</li>
<li>With version 5.0, the <code>sound.properties</code> file can be
used to set default devices for <code>Clip</code>,
<code>Port</code>, <code>SourceDataLine</code>, and
<code>TargetDataLine</code>. For details, see the <code><a href=
"../../../../api/javax/sound/sampled/AudioSystem.html">AudioSystem</a></code>
class in the API; for examples, see <a href=
"appendix2.html">Appendix 2: <code>sound.properties</code> File</a>
in this guide.</li>
<li>While the method for obtaining lines, as outlined below in
Getting a Line of a Desired Type, is still valid, for 5.0 there are
convenience methods for <code>Clip</code>,
<code>SourceDataLine</code>, and <code>TargetDataLine</code>:
<code>AudioSystem.getClip()</code>,
<code>AudioSystem.getSourceDataLine()</code>, and
<code>AudioSystem.getTargetDataLine()</code>. See the
<code><a href="../../../../api/javax/sound/sampled/AudioSystem.html">
AudioSystem</a></code> for details.</li>

<a name="a113096" id="a113096"></a> The Java Sound API takes a
flexible approach to system configuration. Different sorts of audio
devices (mixers) can be installed on a computer. The API makes few
assumptions about what devices have been installed and what their
capabilities are. Instead, it provides ways for the system to
report about the available audio components, and ways for your
program to access them.</p>
<p><a name="a113098" id="a113098"></a> This section shows how your
program can learn what sampled-audio resources have been installed
on the computer, and how it can gain access to the available
resources. Among other things, the resources include mixers and the
various types of lines owned by the mixers.</p>
<a name="a113101" id="a113101"></a>
<h2>The AudioSystem Class</h2>
<p><a name="a113103" id="a113103"></a> The <code>AudioSystem</code>
class acts as a clearinghouse for audio components, including
built-in services and separately installed services from
third-party providers. <code>AudioSystem</code> serves as an
application program's entry point for accessing these installed
sampled-audio resources. You can query the <code>AudioSystem</code>
to learn what sorts of resources have been installed, and then you
can obtain access to them. For example, an application program
might start out by asking the <code>AudioSystem</code> class
whether there is a mixer that has a certain configuration, such as
one of the input or output configurations illustrated earlier in
the discussion of lines. From the mixer, the program would then
obtain data lines, and so on.</p>
<p><a name="a113105" id="a113105"></a> Here are some of the
resources an application program can obtain from the
<code>AudioSystem</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a113107" id=
"a113107"></a></li>
<li>Mixers <a name="a113109" id="a113109"></a> A system typically
has multiple mixers installed. There is usually at least one for
audio input and one for audio output. There might also be mixers
that don't have I/O ports but instead accept audio from an
application program and deliver the mixed audio back to the
program. The <code>AudioSystem</code> class provides a list of all
of the installed mixers. <a name="a113111" id="a113111"></a></li>
<li>Lines <a name="a113113" id="a113113"></a> Even though every
line is associated with a mixer, an application program can get a
line directly from the <code>AudioSystem</code>, without dealing
explicitly with mixers. <a name="a113115" id="a113115"></a></li>
<li>Format conversions <a name="a113117" id="a113117"></a> An
application program can use format conversions to translate audio
data from one format to another. Conversions are described in
Chapter 7, "<a href="chapter7.html">Using Files and Format
Converters</a>." <a name="a113119" id="a113119"></a></li>
<li>Files and streams <a name="a113121" id="a113121"></a> The
<code>AudioSystem</code> class provides methods for translating
between audio files and audio streams. It can also report the file
format of a sound file and can write files in different formats.
These facilities are discussed in Chapter 7, "<a href=
"chapter7.html">Using Files and Format Converters</a>."</li>
</ul>
<a name="a113123" id="a113123"></a>
<h2>Information Objects</h2>
<p><a name="a113125" id="a113125"></a> Several classes in the Java
Sound API provide useful information about associated interfaces.
For example, <code>Mixer.Info</code> provides details about an
installed mixer, such as the mixer's vendor, name, description, and
version. <code>Line.Info</code> obtains the class of a specific
line. Subclasses of <code>Line.Info</code> include
<code>Port.Info</code> and <code>DataLine.Info</code>, which obtain
details relevant to a specific port and data line, respectively.
Each of these classes is described further in the appropriate
section below. It's important not to confuse the <code>Info</code>
object with the mixer or line object that it describes.</p>
<a name="a113128" id="a113128"></a>
<h2>Getting a Mixer</h2>
<p><a name="a113130" id="a113130"></a> Usually, one of the first
things a program that uses the Java Sound API needs to do is to
obtain a mixer, or at least one line of a mixer, so that you can
get sound into or out of the computer. Your program might need a
specific kind of mixer, or you might want to display a list of all
the available mixers so that the user can select one. In either
case, you need to learn what kinds of mixers are installed.
<code>AudioSystem</code> provides the following method:</p>
<pre>
    static Mixer.Info[] getMixerInfo() 
</pre>
Each <code>Mixer.Info</code> object returned by this method
identifies one type of mixer that is installed. (Usually a system
has at most one mixer of a given type. If there happens to be more
than one of a given type, the returned array still only has one
<code>Mixer.Info</code> for that type.) An application program can
iterate over the <code>Mixer.Info</code> objects to find an
appropriate one, according to its needs. The
<code>Mixer.Info</code> includes the following strings to identify
the kind of mixer:
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a113136" id=
"a113136"></a></li>
<li>Name <a name="a113309" id="a113309"></a></li>
<li>Version <a name="a113312" id="a113312"></a></li>
<li>Vendor <a name="a113139" id="a113139"></a></li>
<li>Description
<p><a name="a113141" id="a113141"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
These are arbitrary strings, so an application program that needs a
specific mixer must know what to expect and what to compare the
strings to. The company that provides the mixer should include this
information in its documentation. Alternatively, and perhaps more
typically, the application program will display all the
<code>Mixer.Info</code> objects' strings to the user and let the
user choose the corresponding mixer.
<p><a name="a113143" id="a113143"></a> Once an appropriate mixer is
found, the application program invokes the following
<code>AudioSystem</code> method to obtain the desired mixer:</p>
<pre>
    static Mixer getMixer(Mixer.Info info) 
</pre>
What if your program needs a mixer that has certain capabilities,
but it doesn't need a specific mixer made by a specific vendor? And
what if you can't depend on the user's knowing which mixer should
be chosen? In that case, the information in the
<code>Mixer.Info</code> objects won't be of much use. Instead, you
can iterate over all the <code>Mixer.Info</code> objects returned
by get<code>MixerInfo</code>, get a mixer for each by invoking
<code>getMixer</code>, and query each mixer for its capabilities.
For example, you might need a mixer that can write its mixed audio
data to a certain number of target data lines simultaneously. In
that case, you would query each mixer using this Mixer method:
<code>int</code> getMaxLines<code>(Line.Info info)</code>
<p><a name="a115024" id="a115024"></a> Here, the
<code>Line.Info</code> would specify a <code>TargetDataLine</code>.
The <code>Line.Info</code> class is discussed in the next
section.</p>
<a name="a113154" id="a113154"></a>
<h2>Getting a Line of a Desired Type</h2>
<p><a name="a113156" id="a113156"></a> There are two ways to get a
line:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a113157" id=
"a113157"></a></li>
<li>Directly from the <code>AudioSystem</code> object <a name=
"a113158" id="a113158"></a></li>
<li>From a mixer that you have already obtained from the
<code>AudioSystem</code> object (see "<a href=
"chapter3.html#a113128">Getting a Mixer</a>," in this chapter)</li>
</ul>
<a name="a113159" id="a113159"></a>
<h3>Getting a Line Directly from the AudioSystem</h3>
<p><a name="a113161" id="a113161"></a> Let's assume you haven't
obtained a mixer, and your program is a simple one that really only
needs a certain kind of line; the details of the mixer don't matter
to you. You can use the <code>AudioSystem</code> method:</p>
<pre>
    static Line getLine(Line.Info info)
</pre>
which is analogous to the <code>getMixer</code> method discussed
above. Unlike <code>Mixer.Info</code>, the <code>Line.Info</code>
used as an argument doesn't store textual information to specify
the desired line. Instead, it stores information about the class of
line desired.
<p><a name="a114553" id="a114553"></a> <code>Line.Info</code> is an
abstract class, so you use one of its subclasses
(<code>Port.Info</code> or <code>DataLine.Info</code>) to obtain a
line. The following code excerpt uses the
<code>DataLine.Info</code> subclass to obtain and open a target
data line:</p>
<pre>
TargetDataLine line;
DataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(TargetDataLine.class, 
    format); // format is an AudioFormat object
if (!AudioSystem.isLineSupported(info)) {
    // Handle the error.
    }
    // Obtain and open the line.
try {
    line = (TargetDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(info);
    line.open(format);
} catch (LineUnavailableException ex) {
        // Handle the error.
    //... 
}
</pre>
This code obtains a <code>TargetDataLine</code> object without
specifying any attributes other than its class and its audio
format. You can use analogous code to obtain other kinds of lines.
For a <code>SourceDataLine</code> or a <code>Clip</code>, just
substitute that class for <code>TargetDataLine</code> as the class
of the line variable, and also in the first argument to the
<code>DataLine.Info</code> constructor.
<p><a name="a113191" id="a113191"></a> For a <code>Port</code>, you
can use static instances of <code>Port.Info</code>, in code like
the following:</p>
<pre>
if (AudioSystem.isLineSupported(Port.Info.MICROPHONE)) {
    try {
        line = (Port) AudioSystem.getLine(
            Port.Info.MICROPHONE);
    }
}
</pre>
Note the use of the method <code>isLineSupported</code> to see
whether the mixer even has a line of the desired type.
<p><a name="a113199" id="a113199"></a> Recall that a source line is
an input to a mixer&mdash;namely, a <code>Port</code> object if the
mixer represents an audio-input device, and a
<code>SourceDataLine</code> or <code>Clip</code> object if the
mixer represents an audio-output device. Similarly, a target line
is an output of the mixer: a <code>Port</code> object for an
audio-output mixer, and a <code>TargetDataLine</code> object for an
audio-input mixer. What if a mixer doesn't connect to any external
hardware device at all? For example, consider an internal or
software-only mixer that gets audio from an application program and
delivers its mixed audio back to the program. This kind of mixer
has <code>SourceDataLine</code> or <code>Clip</code> objects for
its input lines and <code>TargetDataLine</code> objects for its
output lines.</p>
<p><a name="a113201" id="a113201"></a> You can also use the
following <code>AudioSystem</code> methods to learn more about
source and target lines of a specified type that are supported by
any installed mixer:</p>
<pre>
    static Line.Info[] getSourceLineInfo(Line.Info info)
    static Line.Info[] getTargetLineInfo(Line.Info info)
</pre>
Note that the array returned by each of these methods indicates
unique types of lines, not necessarily all the lines. For example,
if two of a mixer's lines, or two lines of different mixers, have
identical <code>Line.Info</code> objects, the two lines will
represented by only one <code>Line.Info</code> in the returned
array. <a name="a113208" id="a113208"></a>
<h3>Getting a Line from a Mixer</h3>
<p><a name="a113210" id="a113210"></a> The <code>Mixer</code>
interface includes variations on the <code>AudioSystem</code>
access methods for source and target lines, described above. These
<code>Mixer</code> methods include ones that take
<code>Line.Info</code> arguments, just as
<code>AudioSystem's</code> methods do. However, <code>Mixer</code>
also includes these variants, which take no arguments:</p>
<pre>
<code>    Line.Info[] getSourceLineInfo() 
</code><code>    Line.Info[] getTargetLineInfo() 
</code><br /><a name="a113215" id="a113215"> </a>
</pre>
These methods return arrays of all the <code>Line.Info</code>
objects for the particular mixer. Once you've obtained the arrays,
you can iterate over them, calling <code>Mixer's</code>
<code>getLine</code> method to obtain each line, followed by
<code>Line's</code> <code>open</code> method to reserve use of each
line for your program. <a name="a113216" id="a113216"></a>
<h2>Selecting Input and Output Ports</h2>
<p><a name="a113217" id="a113217"></a> The previous section,
regarding how to obtain a line of a desired type, applies to ports
as well as other types of lines. You can obtain all of the source
(i.e., input) and target (i.e, output) ports by passing a
<code>Port.Info</code> object to the <code>AudioSystem</code> (or
<code>Mixer</code>) methods <code>getSourceLineInfo</code> and
<code>getTargetLineInfo</code> that take a <code>Line.Info</code>
argument. You then iterate over the returned array of objects and
invoke Mixer's <code>getLine</code> method to get each port.</p>
<p><a name="a113219" id="a113219"></a> You can then open each
<code>Port</code> by invoking <code>Line's</code> <code>open</code>
method. Opening a port means you turn it on&mdash;that is, you
allow sound to come in or out the port. Similarly, you can close
ports that you don't want sound to travel through, because some
ports might already be open before you even obtain them. Some
platforms leave all ports on by default; or a user or system
administrator might have selected certain ports to be on or off,
using another application program or operating-system software.</p>
<p><a name="a113220" id="a113220"></a> <strong>Warning:</strong> If
you want to select a certain port and make sure that the sound is
actually going in or out the port, you can open the port as
described. However, this can be considered user-hostile behavior!
For example, a user might have the speaker port turned off so as
not to disturb her co-workers. She would be rather upset if your
program suddenly overrode her wishes and started blaring music. As
another example, a user might want to be assured that his
computer's microphone is never turned on without his knowledge, to
avoid eavesdropping. In general, it is recommended not to open or
close ports unless your program is responding to the user's
intentions, as expressed through the user interface. Instead,
respect the settings that the user or the operating system has
already selected.</p>
<p><a name="a113221" id="a113221"></a> It isn't necessary to open
or close a port before the mixer it's attached to will function
correctly. For example, you can start playing back sound into an
audio-output mixer, even though all its output ports are closed.
The data still flows into the mixer; the playback isn't blocked.
The user just won't hear anything. As soon as the user opens an
output port, the sound will be audible through that port, starting
at whatever point in the media the playback has already
reached.</p>
<p><a name="a113222" id="a113222"></a> Also, you don't need to
access the ports to learn whether the mixer has certain ports. To
learn whether a mixer is actually an audio-output mixer, for
example, you can invoke <code>getTargetLineInfo</code> to see
whether it has output ports. There's no reason to access the ports
themselves unless you want to change their settings (such as their
open-or-closed state, or the settings of any controls they might
have).</p>
<a name="a113223" id="a113223"></a>
<h2>Permission to Use Audio Resources</h2>
<p><a name="a115642" id="a115642"></a> The Java Sound API includes
an <code>AudioPermission</code> class that indicates what kinds of
access an applet (or an application running with a security
manager) can have to the sampled-audio system. Permission to record
sound is controlled separately. This permission should be granted
with care, to help prevent security risks such as unauthorized
eavesdropping. By default, applets and applications are granted
permissions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a115643" id=
"a115643"></a></li>
<li>An <em>applet</em> running with the applet security manager can
play, but not record, audio. <a name="a115633" id=
"a115633"></a></li>
<li>An <em>application</em> running with no security manager can
both play and record audio. <a name="a115637" id=
"a115637"></a></li>
<li>An application running with the default security manager can
play, but not record, audio.
<p><a name="a115653" id="a115653"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
In general, applets are run under the scrutiny of a security
manager and aren't permitted to record sound. Applications, on the
other hand, don't automatically install a security manager, and are
able to record sound. (However, if the default security manager is
invoked explicitly for an application, the application isn't
permitted to record sound.)
<p><a name="a115660" id="a115660"></a> Both applets and
applications can record sound even when running with a security
manager if they have been granted explicit permission to do so.</p>
<p><a name="a113244" id="a113244"></a> If your program doesn't have
permission to record (or play) sound, an exception will be thrown
when it attempts to open a line. There is nothing you can do about
this in your program, other than to catch the exception and report
the problem to the user, because permissions can't be changed
through the API. (If they could, they would be pointless, because
nothing would be secure!) Generally, permissions are set in one or
more policy configuration files, which a user or system
administrator can edit using a text editor or the Policy Tool
program.</p>
<p><a name="a115710" id="a115710"></a> For more information on
security and permissions, see "Security Architecture" and "Policy
Permissions" in the <a href=
