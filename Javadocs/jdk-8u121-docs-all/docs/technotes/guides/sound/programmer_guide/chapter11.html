<h2><u>Note</u></h2>
<p>With the 5.0 release, there is a new real-time
<code>Sequencer</code> (implementation) that works with all Midi
devices and, via its <code>getTransmitter()</code> method, an
unlimited number of transmitters may be obtained. Prior to this
release, it was not possible to get a <code>Transmitter</code> from
a <code>Sequencer</code>.<br /></p>

<p><a name="a120888" id="a120888"></a> In the world of MIDI, a
<em>sequencer</em> is any hardware or software device that can
precisely play or record a <em>sequence</em> of time-stamped MIDI
messages. Similarly, in the Java Sound API, the
<code>Sequencer</code> abstract interface defines the properties of
an object that can play and record <code>Sequences</code> of
<code>MidiEvent</code> objects. A <code>Sequencer</code> typically
loads these <code>MidiEvent</code> sequences from a standard MIDI
file or saves them to such a file. Sequences can also be edited.
This chapter explains how to use <code>Sequencer</code> objects,
along with related classes and interfaces, to accomplish such
tasks.</p>
<a name="a120890" id="a120890"></a>
<h2>Introduction to Sequencers</h2>
<p><a name="a120892" id="a120892"></a> To develop an intuitive
understanding of what a <code>Sequencer</code> is, think of it by
analogy with a tape recorder, which a sequencer resembles in many
respects. Whereas a tape recorder plays audio, a sequencer plays
MIDI data. A sequence is a multi-track, linear, time-ordered
recording of MIDI musical data, which a sequencer can play at
various speeds, rewind, shuttle to particular points, record into,
or copy to a file for storage.</p>
<p><a name="a124503" id="a124503"></a> Chapter 10, "<a href=
"chapter10.html">Transmitting and Receiving MIDI Messages</a>,"
explained that devices typically have <code>Receiver</code>
objects, <code>Transmitter</code> objects, or both. To
<em>play</em> music, a device generally receives
<code>MidiMessages</code> through a <code>Receiver</code>, which in
turn has usually received them from a <code>Transmitter</code> that
belongs to a <code>Sequencer</code>. The device that owns this
<code>Receiver</code> might be a <code>Synthesizer</code>, which
will generate audio directly, or it might be a MIDI output port,
which transmits MIDI data through a physical cable to some external
piece of equipment. Similarly, to <em>record</em> music, a series
of time-stamped <code>MidiMessages</code> are generally sent to a
<code>Receiver</code> owned by a <code>Sequencer</code>, which
places them in a <code>Sequence</code> object. Typically the object
sending the messages is a <code>Transmitter</code> associated with
a hardware input port, and the port relays MIDI data that it gets
from an external instrument. However, the device responsible for
sending the messages might instead be some other
<code>Sequencer</code>, or any other device that has a
<code>Transmitter</code>. Furthermore, as mentioned in Chapter 10,
a program can send messages without using any
<code>Transmitter</code> at all.</p>
<p><a name="a120896" id="a120896"></a> A <code>Sequencer</code>
itself has both <code>Receivers</code> and
<code>Transmitters</code>. When it's recording, it actually obtains
<code>MidiMessages</code> via its <code>Receivers</code>. During
playback, it uses its <code>Transmitters</code> to send
<code>MidiMessages</code> that are stored in the
<code>Sequence</code> that it has recorded (or loaded from a
file).</p>
<p><a name="a124511" id="a124511"></a> One way to think of the role
of a <code>Sequencer</code> in the Java Sound API is as an
aggregator and "de-aggregator" of <code>MidiMessages</code>. A
series of separate <code>MidiMessages</code>, each of which is
independent, is sent to the <code>Sequencer</code> along with its
own time stamp that marks the timing of a musical event. These
<code>MidiMessages</code> are encapsulated in
<code>MidiEvent</code> objects and collected in
<code>Sequence</code> objects through the action of the
<code>Sequencer.record</code> method. A <code>Sequence</code> is a
data structure containing aggregates of <code>MidiEvents</code>,
and it usually represents a series of musical notes, often an
entire song or composition. On playback, the <code>Sequencer</code>
again extracts the <code>MidiMessages</code> from the
<code>MidiEvent</code> objects in the <code>Sequence</code> and
then transmits them to one or more devices that will either render
them into sound, save them, modify them, or pass them on to some
other device.</p>
<p><a name="a124522" id="a124522"></a> Some sequencers might have
neither transmitters nor receivers. For example, they might create
<code>MidiEvents</code> from scratch as a result of keyboard or
mouse events, instead of receiving <code>MidiMessages</code>
through <code>Receivers</code>. Similarly, they might play music by
communicating directly with an internal synthesizer (which could
actually be the same object as the sequencer) instead of sending
<code>MidiMessages</code> to a <code>Receiver</code> associated
with a separate object. However, the rest of this chapter assumes
the normal case of a sequencer that uses <code>Receivers</code> and
<code>Transmitters</code>.</p>
<a name="when" id="when"></a>
<h3>When to Use a Sequencer</h3>
<p><a name="a124536" id="a124536"></a> It's possible for an
application program to send MIDI messages directly to a device,
without using a sequencer, as was described in Chapter 10,
"<a href="chapter10.html">Transmitting and Receiving MIDI
Messages</a>." The program simply invokes the
<code>Receiver.send</code> method each time it wants to send a
message. This is a straightforward approach that's useful when the
program itself creates the messages in real time. For example,
consider a program that lets the user play notes by clicking on an
onscreen piano keyboard. When the program gets a mouse-down event,
it immediately sends the appropriate Note On message to the
synthesizer.</p>
<p><a name="a124540" id="a124540"></a> As mentioned in Chapter 10,
the program can include a time stamp with each MIDI message it
sends to the device's receiver. However, such time stamps are used
only for fine-tuning the timing, to correct for processing latency.
The caller can't generally set arbitrary time stamps; the time
value passed to <code>Receiver.send</code> must be close to the
present time, or the receiving device might not be able to schedule
the message correctly. This means that if an application program
wanted to create a queue of MIDI messages for an entire piece of
music ahead of time (instead of creating each message in response
to a real-time event), it would have to be very careful to schedule
each invocation of <code>Receiver.send</code> for nearly the right
time.</p>
<p><a name="a124541" id="a124541"></a> Fortunately, most
application programs don't have to be concerned with such
scheduling. Instead of invoking <code>Receiver.send</code> itself,
a program can use a <code>Sequencer</code> object to manage the
queue of MIDI messages for it. The sequencer takes care of
scheduling and sending the messages&mdash;in other words, playing
the music with the correct timing. Generally, it's advantageous to
use a sequencer whenever you need to convert a non-real-time series
of MIDI messages to a real-time series (as in playback), or vice
versa (as in recording). Sequencers are most commonly used for
playing data from MIDI files and for recording data from a MIDI
input port.</p>
<a name="a124542" id="a124542"></a>
<h2>Understanding Sequence Data</h2>
<p><a name="a124543" id="a124543"></a> Before examining the
<code>Sequencer</code> API, it helps to understand the kind of data
that's stored in a sequence.</p>
<a name="a124544" id="a124544"></a>
<h3>Sequences and Tracks</h3>
<p><a name="a124545" id="a124545"></a> In the Java Sound API,
sequencers closely follow the Standard MIDI Files specification in
the way that they organize recorded MIDI data. As mentioned above,
a <code>Sequence</code> is an aggregation of
<code>MidiEvents</code>, organized in time. But there is more
structure to a <code>Sequence</code> than just a linear series of
<code>MidiEvents</code>: a <code>Sequence</code> actually contains
global timing information plus a collection of <code>Tracks</code>,
and it is the <code>Tracks</code> themselves that hold the
<code>MidiEvent</code> data. So the data played by a sequencer
consists of a three-level hierarchy of objects:
<code>Sequencer</code>, <code>Track</code>, and
<code>MidiEvent</code>.</p>
<p><a name="a124546" id="a124546"></a> In the conventional use of
these objects, the <code>Sequence</code> represents a complete
musical composition or section of a composition, with each
<code>Track</code> corresponding to a voice or player in the
ensemble. In this model, all the data on a particular
<code>Track</code> would also therefore be encoded into a
particular MIDI channel reserved for that voice or player.</p>
<p><a name="a124547" id="a124547"></a> This way of organizing data
is convenient for purposes of editing sequences, but note that this
is just a conventional way to use <code>Tracks</code>. There is
nothing in the definition of the <code>Track</code> class per se
that keeps it from containing a mix of <code>MidiEvents</code> on
different MIDI channels. For example, an entire multi-channel MIDI
composition can be mixed and recorded onto one <code>Track</code>.
Also, standard MIDI files of Type 0 (as opposed to Type 1 and Type
2) contain by definition only one track; so a <code>Sequence</code>
that's read from such a file will necessarily have a single
<code>Track</code> object.</p>
<a name="a124548" id="a124548"></a>
<h3>MidiEvents and Ticks</h3>
<p><a name="a124552" id="a124552"></a> As discussed in Chapter 8,
"<a href="chapter8.html">Overview of the MIDI Package</a>," the
Java Sound API includes <code>MidiMessage</code> objects that
correspond to the raw two- or three-byte sequences that make up
most standard MIDI messages. A <code>MidiEvent</code> is simply a
packaging of a <code>MidiMessage</code> along with an accompanying
timing value that specifies when the event occurs. (We might then
say that a sequence really consists of a four- or five-level
hierarchy of data, rather than three-level, because the ostensible
lowest level, <code>MidiEvent</code>, actually contains a
lower-level <code>MidiMessage</code>, and likewise the
<code>MidiMessage</code> object contains an array of bytes that
comprises a standard MIDI message.)</p>
<p><a name="a124553" id="a124553"></a> In the Java Sound API, there
are two different ways in which <code>MidiMessages</code> can be
associated with timing values. One is the way mentioned above under
"<a href="chapter11.html#when">When to Use a Sequencer</a>." This
technique is described in detail under "<a href=
"chapter10.html#sending">Sending a Message to a Receiver without
Using a Transmitter</a>" and "<a href=
"chapter10.html#understanding_time">Understanding Time Stamps</a>"
in Chapter 10, "<a href="chapter10.html">Transmitting and Receiving
MIDI Messages</a>." There, we saw that the <code>send</code> method
of <code>Receiver</code> takes a <code>MidiMessage</code> argument
and a time-stamp argument. That kind of time stamp can only be
expressed in microseconds.</p>
<p><a name="a124566" id="a124566"></a> The other way in which a
<code>MidiMessage</code> can have its timing specified is by being
encapsulated in a <code>MidiEvent</code>. In this case, the timing
is expressed in slightly more abstract units called
<em>ticks</em>.</p>
<p><a name="a124567" id="a124567"></a> What is the duration of a
tick? It can vary between sequences (but not within a sequence),
and its value is stored in the header of a standard MIDI file. The
size of a tick is given in one of two types of units:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a124568" id=
"a124568"></a></li>
<li>Pulses (ticks) per quarter note, abbreviated as PPQ <a name="a124569"></a></li>
<li>Ticks per frame, also known as SMPTE time code (a standard
adopted by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers)
<p><a name="a124570" id="a124570"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
If the unit is PPQ, the size of a tick is expressed as a fraction
of a quarter note, which is a relative, not absolute, time value. A
quarter note is a musical duration value that often corresponds to
one beat of the music (a quarter of a measure in 4/4 time). The
duration of a quarter note is dependent on the tempo, which can
vary during the course of the music if the sequence contains
tempo-change events. So if the sequence's timing increments (ticks)
occur, say 96 times per quarter note, each event's timing value
measures that event's position in musical terms, not as an absolute
time value.
<p><a name="a124571" id="a124571"></a> On the other hand, in the
case of SMPTE, the units measure absolute time, and the notion of
tempo is inapplicable. There are actually four different SMPTE
conventions available, which refer to the number of motion-picture
frames per second. The number of frames per second can be 24, 25,
29.97, or 30. With SMPTE time code, the size of a tick is expressed
as a fraction of a frame.</p>
<p><a name="a124572" id="a124572"></a> In the Java Sound API, you
can invoke <code>Sequence.getDivisionType</code> to learn which
type of unit&mdash;namely, PPQ or one of the SMPTE units&mdash;is
used in a particular sequence. You can then calculate the size of a
tick after invoking <code>Sequence.getResolution</code>. The latter
method returns the number of ticks per quarter note if the division
type is PPQ, or per SMPTE frame if the division type is one of the
SMPTE conventions. You can get the size of a tick using this
formula in the case of PPQ:</p>
<pre>
ticksPerSecond =  
    resolution * (currentTempoInBeatsPerMinute / 60.0);
tickSize = 1.0 / ticksPerSecond;
</pre>
<p><a name="a124576" id="a124576"></a> and this formula in the case
of SMPTE:</p>
<pre>
framesPerSecond = 
  (divisionType == Sequence.SMPTE_24 ? 24
    : (divisionType == Sequence.SMPTE_25 ? 25
      : (divisionType == Sequence.SMPTE_30 ? 30
        : (divisionType == Sequence.SMPTE_30DROP ?<br />            29.97))));
ticksPerSecond = resolution * framesPerSecond;
tickSize = 1.0 / ticksPerSecond;
</pre>
<p><a name="a124584" id="a124584"></a> The Java Sound API's
definition of timing in a sequence mirrors that of the Standard
MIDI Files specification. However, there's one important
difference. The tick values contained in <code>MidiEvents</code>
measure <em>cumulative</em> time, rather than <em>delta</em> time.
In a standard MIDI file, each event's timing information measures
the amount of time elapsed since the onset of the previous event in
the sequence. This is called delta time. But in the Java Sound API,
the ticks aren't delta values; they're the previous event's time
value <em>plus</em> the delta value. In other words, in the Java
Sound API the timing value for each event is always greater than
that of the previous event in the sequence (or equal, if the events
are supposed to be simultaneous). Each event's timing value
measures the time elapsed since the beginning of the sequence.</p>
<p><a name="a124585" id="a124585"></a> To summarize, the Java Sound
API expresses timing information in either MIDI ticks or
microseconds. <code>MidiEvents</code> store timing information in
terms of MIDI ticks. The duration of a tick can be calculated from
the <code>Sequence's</code> global timing information and, if the
sequence uses tempo-based timing, the current musical tempo. The
time stamp associated with a <code>MidiMessage</code> sent to a
<code>Receiver</code>, on the other hand, is always expressed in
microseconds.</p>
<p><a name="a124586" id="a124586"></a> One goal of this design is
to avoid conflicting notions of time. It's the job of a
<code>Sequencer</code> to interpret the time units in its
<code>MidiEvents</code>, which might have PPQ units, and translate
these into absolute time in microseconds, taking the current tempo
into account. The sequencer must also express the microseconds
relative to the time when the device receiving the message was
opened. Note that a sequencer can have multiple transmitters, each
delivering messages to a different receiver that might be
associated with a completely different device. You can see, then,
that the sequencer has to be able to perform multiple translations
at the same time, making sure that each device receives time stamps
appropriate for its notion of time.</p>
<p><a name="a124587" id="a124587"></a> To make matters more
complicated, different devices might update their notions of time
based on different sources (such as the operating system's clock,
or a clock maintained by a sound card). This means that their
timings can drift relative to the sequencer's. To keep in
synchronization with the sequencer, some devices permit themselves
to be "slaves" to the sequencer's notion of time. Setting masters
and slaves is discussed later under "<a href=
"chapter11.html#a124684">Using Advanced Sequencer Features</a>."</p>
<a name="a124591" id="a124591"></a>
<h2>Overview of Sequencer Methods</h2>
<p><a name="a124592" id="a124592"></a> The <code>Sequencer</code>
interface provides methods in several categories:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a124593" id=
"a124593"></a></li>
<li>Methods to load sequence data from a MIDI file or a
<code>Sequence</code> object, and to save the currently loaded
sequence data to a MIDI file. <a name="a124594" id=
"a124594"></a></li>
<li>Methods analogous to the transport functions of a tape
recorder, for stopping and starting playback and recording,
enabling and disabling recording on specific tracks, and shuttling
the current playback or recording position in a
<code>Sequence</code>. <a name="a124595" id="a124595"></a></li>
<li>Advanced methods for querying and setting the synchronization
and timing parameters of the object. A <code>Sequencer</code> may
play at different tempos, with some <code>Tracks</code> muted, and
in various synchronization states with other objects. <a name="a124596"></a></li>
<li>Advanced methods for registering "listener" objects that are
notified when the <code>Sequencer</code> processes certain kinds of
MIDI events.
<p><a name="a124597" id="a124597"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
Regardless of which <code>Sequencer</code> methods you'll invoke,
the first step is to obtain a <code>Sequencer</code> device from
the system and reserve it for your program's use. <a name="a124598"></a>
<h2>Obtaining a Sequencer</h2>
<p><a name="a124599" id="a124599"></a> An application program
doesn't instantiate a <code>Sequencer</code>; after all,
<code>Sequencer</code> is just an interface. Instead, like all
devices in the Java Sound API's MIDI package, a
<code>Sequencer</code> is accessed through the static
<code>MidiSystem</code> object. As mentioned in Chapter 9,
"<a href="chapter9.html">Accessing MIDI System Resources</a>," the
following <code>MidiSystem</code> method can be used to obtain the
default <code>Sequencer</code>:</p>
<pre>
    static Sequencer getSequencer()
</pre>
<p><a name="a124604" id="a124604"></a> The following code fragment
obtains the default <code>Sequencer</code>, acquires any system
resources it needs, and makes it operational:</p>
<pre>
    Sequencer sequencer;
    // Get default sequencer.
    sequencer = MidiSystem.getSequencer(); 
    if (sequencer == null) {
        // Error -- sequencer device is not supported.
        // Inform user and return...
    } else {
         // Acquire resources and make operational.
        sequencer.open();
    }
        
</pre>
<p><a name="a124615" id="a124615"></a> The invocation of
<code>open</code> reserves the sequencer device for your program's
use. It doesn't make much sense to imagine sharing a sequencer,
because it can play only one sequence at a time. When you're done
using the sequencer, you can make it available to other programs by
invoking <code>close</code>.</p>
<p><a name="a124616" id="a124616"></a> Non-default sequencers can
be obtained as described in Chapter 9, "<a href=
"chapter9.html">Accessing MIDI System Resources</a>."</p>
<a name="a124620" id="a124620"></a>
<h2>Loading a Sequence</h2>
<p><a name="a124621" id="a124621"></a> Having obtained a sequencer
from the system and reserved it, you then need load the data that
the sequencer should play. There are three typical ways of
accomplishing this:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a124622" id=
"a124622"></a></li>
<li>Reading the sequence data from a MIDI file <a name="a124623"></a></li>
<li>Recording it in real time by receiving MIDI messages from
another device, such as a MIDI input port <a name="a124624"></a></li>
<li>Building it programmatically "from scratch" by adding tracks to
an empty sequence and adding <code>MidiEvent</code> objects to
those tracks
<p><a name="a124625" id="a124625"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
We'll now look at the first of these ways of getting sequence data.
(The other two ways are described later under "<a href=
"chapter11.html#a124654">Recording and Saving Sequences</a>" and
"<a href="chapter11.html#a124674">Editing a Sequence</a>,"
respectively.) This first way actually encompasses two slightly
different approaches. One approach is to feed MIDI file data to an
<code>InputStream</code> that you then read directly to the
sequencer by means of
<code>Sequencer.setSequence(InputStream)</code>. With this
approach, you don't explicitly create a <code>Sequence</code>
object. In fact, the <code>Sequencer</code> implementation might
not even create a <code>Sequence</code> behind the scenes, because
some sequencers have a built-in mechanism for handling data
directly from a file.
<p><a name="a124632" id="a124632"></a> The other approach is to
create a <code>Sequence</code> explicitly. You'll need to use this
approach if you're going to edit the sequence data before playing
it. With this approach, you invoke <code>MidiSystem's</code>
overloaded method <code>getSequence</code>. The method is able to
get the sequence from an <code>InputStream</code>, a
<code>File</code>, or a <code>URL</code>. The method returns a
<code>Sequence</code> object that can then be loaded into a
<code>Sequencer</code> for playback. Expanding on the previous code
excerpt, here's an example of obtaining a <code>Sequence</code>
object from a <code>File</code> and loading it into our
<code>sequencer</code>:</p>
<pre>
    try {
        File myMidiFile = new File("seq1.mid");
        // Construct a Sequence object, and
        // load it into my sequencer.
         Sequence mySeq = MidiSystem.getSequence(myMidiFile);
        sequencer.setSequence(mySeq);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle error and/or return
    }
        
</pre>
<p><a name="a124642" id="a124642"></a> Like
<code>MidiSystem's</code> <code>getSequence</code> method,
<code>setSequence</code> may throw an
<code>InvalidMidiDataException</code>&mdash;and, in the case of the
<code>InputStream</code> variant, an
<code>IOException</code>&mdash;if it runs into any trouble.</p>
<a name="a124643" id="a124643"></a>
<h2>Playing a Sequence</h2>
<p><a name="a124644" id="a124644"></a> Starting and stopping a
<code>Sequencer</code> is accomplished using the following
methods:</p>
<pre>
    void start()
</pre>
<p><a name="a124646" id="a124646"></a> and</p>
<pre>
    void stop()
</pre>
<p><a name="a124648" id="a124648"></a> The
<code>Sequencer.start</code> method begins playback of the
sequence. Note that playback starts at the current position in a
sequence. Loading an existing sequence using the
<code>setSequence</code> method, described above, initializes the
sequencer's current position to the very beginning of the sequence.
The <code>stop</code> method stops the sequencer, but it does not
automatically rewind the current <code>Sequence</code>. Starting a
stopped <code>Sequence</code> without resetting the position simply
resumes playback of the sequence from the current position. In this
case, the <code>stop</code> method has served as a pause operation.
However, there are various <code>Sequencer</code> methods for
setting the current sequence position to an arbitrary value before
playback is started. (We'll discuss these methods below.)</p>
<p><a name="a124649" id="a124649"></a> As mentioned earlier, a
<code>Sequencer</code> typically has one or more
<code>Transmitter</code> objects, through which it sends
<code>MidiMessages</code> to a <code>Receiver</code>. It is through
these <code>Transmitters</code> that a <code>Sequencer</code> plays
the <code>Sequence</code>, by emitting appropriately timed
<code>MidiMessages</code> that correspond to the
<code>MidiEvents</code> contained in the current
<code>Sequence</code>. Therefore, part of the setup procedure for
playing back a <code>Sequence</code> is to invoke the
<code>setReceiver</code> method on the <code>Sequencer's</code>
<code>Transmitter</code> object, in effect wiring its output to the
device that will make use of the played-back data. For more details
on <code>Transmitters</code> and <code>Receivers</code>, see
Chapter 10, "<a href="chapter10.html">Transmitting and Receiving
MIDI Messages</a>."</p>
<a name="a124654" id="a124654"></a>
<h2>Recording and Saving Sequences</h2>
<p><a name="a124655" id="a124655"></a> To capture MIDI data to a
<code>Sequence</code>, and subsequently to a file, you need to
perform some additional steps beyond those described above. The
following outline shows the steps necessary to set up for recording
to a <code>Track</code> in a <code>Sequence</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a124656" id=
"a124656"></a></li>
<li>Use <code>MidiSystem.getSequencer</code> to get a new sequencer
to use for recording, as above. <a name="a124657" id=
"a124657"></a></li>
<li>Set up the "wiring" of the MIDI connections. The object that is
transmitting the MIDI data to be recorded should be configured,
through its <code>setReceiver</code> method, to send data to a
<code>Receiver</code> associated with the recording
<code>Sequencer</code>. <a name="a124658" id="a124658"></a></li>
<li>Create a new <code>Sequence</code> object, which will store the
recorded data. When you create the <code>Sequence</code> object,
you must specify the global timing information for the sequence.
For example:
<pre>
      Sequence mySeq;
      try{
          mySeq = new Sequence(Sequence.PPQ, 10);
      } catch (Exception ex) { 
          ex.printStackTrace(); 
      }
</pre>
<a name="a124666" id="a124666"></a> The constructor for
<code>Sequence</code> takes as arguments a
<code>divisionType</code> and a timing resolution. The
<code>divisionType</code> argument specifies the units of the
resolution argument. In this case, we've specified that the timing
resolution of the <code>Sequence</code> we're creating will be 10
pulses per quarter note. An additional optional argument to the
<code>Sequence</code> constructor is a number of tracks argument,
which would cause the initial sequence to begin with the specified
number of (initially empty) <code>Tracks</code>. Otherwise the
<code>Sequence</code> will be created with no initial
<code>Tracks</code>; they can be added later as needed. <a name="a124667"></a></li>
<li>Create an empty <code>Track</code> in the
<code>Sequence</code>, with <code>Sequence.createTrack</code>. This
step is unnecessary if the <code>Sequence</code> was created with
initial <code>Tracks</code>. <a name="a124668" id=
"a124668"></a></li>
<li>Using <code>Sequencer.setSequence</code>, select our new
<code>Sequence</code> to receive the recording. The
<code>setSequence</code> method ties together an existing
<code>Sequence</code> with the <code>Sequencer</code>, which is
somewhat analogous to loading a tape onto a tape recorder. <a name="a124669"></a></li>
<li>Invoke <code>Sequencer.recordEnable</code> for each
<code>Track</code> to be recorded. If necessary, get a reference to
the available <code>Tracks</code> in the <code>Sequence</code> by
invoking <code>Sequence.getTracks</code>. <a name="a124670"></a></li>
<li>Invoke <code>startRecording</code> on the
<code>Sequencer</code>. <a name="a124671" id="a124671"></a></li>
<li>When done recording, invoke <code>Sequencer.stop</code> or
<code>Sequencer.stopRecording</code>. <a name="a124672" id=
"a124672"></a></li>
<li>Save the recorded <code>Sequence</code> to a MIDI file with
<code>MidiSystem.write</code>. The <code>write</code> method of
<code>MidiSystem</code> takes a <code>Sequence</code> as one of its
arguments, and will write that <code>Sequence</code> to a stream or
file.</li>
</ol>
<a name="a124674" id="a124674"></a>
<h2>Editing a Sequence</h2>
<p><a name="a124675" id="a124675"></a> Many application programs
allow a sequence to be created by loading it from a file, and quite
a few also allow a sequence to be created by capturing it from live
MIDI input (that is, recording). Some programs, however, will need
to create MIDI sequences from scratch, whether programmatically or
in response to user input. Full-featured sequencer programs permit
the user to manually construct new sequences, as well as to edit
existing ones.</p>
<p><a name="a124676" id="a124676"></a> These data-editing
operations are achieved in the Java Sound API not by
<code>Sequencer</code> methods, but by methods of the data objects
themselves: <code>Sequence</code>, <code>Track</code>, and
<code>MidiEvent</code>. You can create an empty sequence using one
of the <code>Sequence</code> constructors, and then add tracks to
it by invoking the following <code>Sequence</code> method:</p>
<pre>
    Track createTrack() 
<br /><a name="a124678" id="a124678"> </a>
</pre>
If your program allows the user to edit sequences, you'll need this
<code>Sequence</code> method to remove tracks:
<pre>
    boolean deleteTrack(Track track) 
</pre>
<p><a name="a124680" id="a124680"></a> Once the sequence contains
tracks, you can modify the contents of the tracks by invoking
methods of the <code>Track</code> class. The
<code>MidiEvents</code> contained in the <code>Track</code> are
stored as a <code>java.util.Vector</code> in the <code>Track</code>
object, and <code>Track</code> provides a set of methods for
accessing, adding, and removing the events in the list. The methods
<code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> are fairly
self-explanatory, adding or removing a specified
<code>MidiEvent</code> from a <code>Track</code>. A
<code>get</code> method is provided, which takes an index into the
<code>Track's</code> event list and returns the
<code>MidiEvent</code> stored there. In addition, there are
<code>size</code> and <code>tick</code> methods, which respectively
return the number of <code>MidiEvents</code> in the track, and the
track's duration, expressed as a total number of
<code>Ticks</code>.</p>
<p><a name="a124681" id="a124681"></a> To create a new event before
adding it to the track, you'll of course use the
<code>MidiEvent</code> constructor. To specify or modify the MIDI
message embedded in the event, you can invoke the
<code>setMessage</code> method of the appropriate
<code>MidiMessage</code> subclass (<code>ShortMessage</code>,
<code>SysexMessage</code>, or <code>MetaMessage</code>). To modify
the time that the event should occur, invoke
<code>MidiEvent.setTick</code>.</p>
<p><a name="a124682" id="a124682"></a> In combination, these
low-level methods provide the basis for the editing functionality
needed by a full-featured sequencer program.</p>
<a name="a124684" id="a124684"></a>
<h2>Using Advanced Sequencer Features</h2>
<p><a name="a124685" id="a124685"></a> So far, this chapter has
focused on simple playback and recording of MIDI data. This section
will briefly describe some of the more advanced features available
through methods of the <code>Sequencer</code> interface and the
<code>Sequence</code> class.</p>
<a name="a124686" id="a124686"></a>
<h3>Moving to an Arbitrary Position in the Sequence</h3>
<p><a name="a124687" id="a124687"></a> There are two
<code>Sequencer</code> methods that obtain the sequencer's current
position in the sequence. The first of these:</p>
<pre>
    long getTickPosition()
</pre>
<p><a name="a124689" id="a124689"></a> returns the position
measured in MIDI ticks from the beginning of the sequence. The
second method:</p>
<pre>
long getMicrosecondPosition()
</pre>
<p><a name="a124691" id="a124691"></a> returns the current position
in microseconds. This method assumes that the sequence is being
played at the default rate as stored in the MIDI file or in the
<code>Sequence</code>. It does <em>not</em> return a different
value if you've changed the playback speed as described below.</p>
<p><a name="a124692" id="a124692"></a> You can similarly set the
sequencer's current position according to one unit or the
other:</p>
<pre>
void setTickPosition(long tick)
</pre>
<p><a name="a124694" id="a124694"></a> or</p>
<pre>
void setMicrosecondPosition(long microsecond)
</pre>
<a name="a124696" id="a124696"></a>
<h3>Changing the Playback Speed</h3>
<p><a name="a124697" id="a124697"></a> As indicated earlier, a
sequence's speed is indicated by its tempo, which can vary over the
course of the sequence. A sequence can contain events that
encapsulate standard MIDI tempo-change messages. When the sequencer
processes such an event, it changes the speed of playback to
reflect the indicated tempo. In addition, you can programmatically
change the tempo by invoking any of these <code>Sequencer</code>
methods:</p>
<pre>
    public void setTempoInBPM(float bpm)
    public void setTempoInMPQ(float mpq)
    public void setTempoFactor(float factor)
</pre>
The first two of these methods set the tempo in beats per minute or
microseconds per quarter note, respectively. The tempo will stay at
the specified value until one of these methods is invoked again, or
until a tempo-change event is encountered in the sequence, at which
point the current tempo is overridden by the newly specified one.
<p><a name="a124702" id="a124702"></a> The third method,
<code>setTempoFactor</code>, is different in nature. It scales
whatever tempo is set for the sequencer (whether by tempo-change
events or by one of the first two methods above). The default
scalar is 1.0 (no change). Although this method causes the playback
or recording to be faster or slower than the nominal tempo (unless
the factor is 1.0), it doesn't alter the nominal tempo. In other
words, the tempo values returned by <code>getTempoInBPM</code> and
<code>getTempoInMPQ</code> are unaffected by the tempo factor, even
though the tempo factor does affect the actual rate of playback or
recording. Also, if the tempo is changed by a tempo-change event or
by one of the first two methods, it still gets scaled by whatever
tempo factor was last set. If you load a new sequence, however, the
tempo factor is reset to 1.0.</p>
<p><a name="a124703" id="a124703"></a> Note that all these
tempo-change directives are ineffectual when the sequence's
division type is one of the SMPTE types, instead of PPQ.</p>
<a name="a124704" id="a124704"></a>
<h3>Muting or Soloing Individual Tracks in the Sequence</h3>
<p><a name="a124705" id="a124705"></a> It's often convenient for
users of sequencers to be able to turn off certain tracks, to hear
more clearly exactly what is happening in the music. A
full-featured sequencer program lets the user choose which tracks
should sound during playback. (Speaking more precisely, since
sequencers don't actually create sound themselves, the user chooses
which tracks will contribute to the stream of MIDI messages that
the sequencer produces.) Typically, there are two types of
graphical controls on each track: a <em>mute</em> button and a
<em>solo</em> button. If the mute button is activated, that track
will not sound under any circumstances, until the mute button is
deactivated. Soloing is a less well-known feature. It's roughly the
opposite of muting. If the solo button on any track is activated,
only tracks whose solo buttons are activated will sound. This
feature lets the user quickly audition a small number of tracks
without having to mute all the other tracks. The mute button
typically takes priority over the solo button: if both are
activated, the track doesn't sound.</p>
<p><a name="a124706" id="a124706"></a> Using <code>Sequencer</code>
methods, muting or soloing tracks (as well as querying a track's
current mute or solo state) is easily accomplished. Let's assume we
have obtained the default <code>Sequencer</code> and that we've
loaded sequence data into it. Muting the fifth track in the
sequence would be accomplished as follows:</p>
<pre>
    sequencer.setTrackMute(4, true);
    boolean muted = sequencer.getTrackMute(4);
    if (!muted) { 
        return;         // muting failed
    }
</pre>
There are a couple of things to note about the above code snippet.
First, tracks of a sequence are numbered starting with 0 and ending
with the total number of tracks minus 1. Also, the second argument
to <code>setTrackMute</code> is a boolean. If it's true, the
request is to mute the track; otherwise the request is to unmute
the specified track. Lastly, in order to test that the muting took
effect, we invoke the <code>Sequencer getTrackMute</code> method,
passing it the track number we're querying. If it returns
<code>true</code>, as we'd expect in this case, then the mute
request worked. If it returns <code>false</code>, then it failed.
<p><a name="a124713" id="a124713"></a> Mute requests may fail for
various reasons. For example, the track number specified in the
<code>setTrackMute</code> call might exceed the total number of
tracks, or the sequencer might not support muting. By calling
<code>getTrackMute</code>, we can determine if our request
succeeded or failed.</p>
<p><a name="a124714" id="a124714"></a> As an aside, the boolean
that's returned by <code>getTrackMute</code> can, indeed, tell us
if a failure occurred, but it can't tell us why it occurred. We
could test to see if a failure was caused by passing an invalid
track number to the <code>setTrackMute</code> method. To do this,
we would call the <code>getTracks</code> method of
<code>Sequence</code>, which returns an array containing all of the
tracks in the sequence. If the track number specified in the
<code>setTrackMute</code> call exceeds the length of this array,
then we know we specified an invalid track number.</p>
<p><a name="a124715" id="a124715"></a> If the mute request
succeeded, then in our example, the fifth track will not sound when
the sequence is playing, nor will any other tracks that are
currently muted.</p>
<p><a name="a124716" id="a124716"></a> The method and techniques
for soloing a track are very similar to those for muting. To solo a
track, invoke the <code>setTrackSolo</code> method of
<code>Sequence:</code></p>
<pre>
void setTrackSolo(int track, boolean bSolo)
</pre>
As in <code>setTrackMute</code>, the first argument specifies the
zero-based track number, and the second argument, if
<code>true</code>, specifies that the track should be in solo mode;
otherwise the track should not be soloed.
<p><a name="a124719" id="a124719"></a> By default, a track is
neither muted nor soloed.</p>
<a name="a124721" id="a124721"></a>
<h3>Synchronizing with Other MIDI Devices</h3>
<p><a name="a124722" id="a124722"></a> <code>Sequencer</code> has
an inner class called <code>Sequencer.SyncMode</code>. A
<code>SyncMode</code> object represents one of the ways in which a
MIDI sequencer's notion of time can be synchronized with a master
or slave device. If the sequencer is being synchronized to a
master, the sequencer revises its current time in response to
certain MIDI messages from the master. If the sequencer has a
slave, the sequencer similarly sends MIDI messages to control the
slave's timing.</p>
<p><a name="a124723" id="a124723"></a> There are three predefined
modes that specify possible masters for a sequencer:
<code>INTERNAL_CLOCK</code>, <code>MIDI_SYNC</code>, and
<code>MIDI_TIME_CODE</code>. The latter two work if the sequencer
receives MIDI messages from another device. In these two modes, the
sequencer's time gets reset based on system real-time timing clock
messages or MIDI time code (MTC) messages, respectively. (See the
MIDI specification for more information about these types of
message.) These two modes can also be used as slave modes, in which
case the sequencer sends the corresponding types of MIDI messages
to its receiver. A fourth mode, <code>NO_SYNC</code>, is used to
indicate that the sequencer should not send timing information to
its receivers.</p>
<p><a name="a124724" id="a124724"></a> By calling the
<code>setMasterSyncMode</code> method with a supported
<code>SyncMode</code> object as the argument, you can specify how
the sequencer's timing is controlled. Likewise, the
<code>setSlaveSyncMode</code> method determines what timing
information the sequencer will send to its receivers. This
information controls the timing of devices that use the sequencer
as a master timing source.</p>
<a name="a124725" id="a124725"></a>
<h3>Specifying Special Event Listeners</h3>
<p><a name="a124726" id="a124726"></a> Each track of a sequence can
contain many different kinds of <code>MidiEvents</code>. Such
events include Note On and Note Off messages, program changes,
control changes, and meta events. The Java Sound API specifies
"listener" interfaces for the last two of these event types
(control change events and meta events). You can use these
interfaces to receive notifications when such events occur during
playback of a sequence.</p>
<p><a name="a124727" id="a124727"></a> Objects that support the
<code>ControllerEventListener</code> interface can receive
notification when a <code>Sequencer</code> processes particular
control-change messages. A control-change message is a standard
type of MIDI message that represents a change in the value of a
MIDI controller, such as a pitch-bend wheel or a data slider. (See
the MIDI specification for the complete list of control-change
messages.) When such a message is processed during playback of a
sequence, the message instructs any device (probably a synthesizer)
that's receiving the data from the sequencer to update the value of
some parameter. The parameter usually controls some aspect of sound
synthesis, such as the pitch of the currently sounding notes if the
controller was the pitch-bend wheel. When a sequence is being
recorded, the control-change message means that a controller on the
external physical device that created the message has been moved,
or that such a move has been simulated in software.</p>
<p><a name="a124728" id="a124728"></a> Here's how the
<code>ControllerEventListener</code> interface is used. Let's
assume that you've developed a class that implements the
<code>ControllerEventListener</code> interface, meaning that your
class contains the following method:</p>
<pre>
    void controlChange(ShortMessage msg)
</pre>
Let's also assume that you've created an instance of your class and
assigned it to a variable called <code>myListener</code>. If you
include the following statements somewhere within your program:
<pre>
    int[] controllersOfInterest = { 1, 2, 4 };
    sequencer.addControllerEventListener(myListener,
        controllersOfInterest);
</pre>
then your class's <code>controlChange</code> method will be invoked
every time the sequencer processes a control-change message for
MIDI controller numbers 1, 2, or 4. In other words, when the
<code>Sequencer</code> processes a request to set the value of any
of the registered controllers, the <code>Sequencer</code> will
invoke your class's <code>controlChange</code> method. (Note that
the assignments of MIDI controller numbers to specific control
devices is detailed in the MIDI 1.0 Specification.)
<p><a name="a124734" id="a124734"></a> The
<code>controlChange</code> method is passed a
<code>ShortMessage</code> containing the controller number
affected, and the new value to which the controller was set. You
can obtain the controller number using the
<code>ShortMessage.getData1</code> method, and the new setting of
the controller's value using the <code>ShortMessage.getData2</code>
method.</p>
<p><a name="a124735" id="a124735"></a> The other kind of special
event listener is defined by the <code>MetaEventListener</code>
interface. Meta messages, according to the Standard MIDI Files 1.0
specification, are messages that are not present in MIDI wire
protocol but that can be embedded in a MIDI file. They are not
meaningful to a synthesizer, but can be interpreted by a sequencer.
Meta messages include instructions (such as tempo change commands),
lyrics or other text, and other indicators (such as
end-of-track).</p>
<p><a name="a124736" id="a124736"></a> The
<code>MetaEventListener</code> mechanism is analogous to
<code>ControllerEventListener</code>. Implement the
<code>MetaEventListener</code> interface in any class whose
instances need to be notified when a <code>MetaMessage</code> is
processed by the sequencer. This involves adding the following
method to the class:</p>
<pre>
void meta(MetaMessage msg)
</pre>
<p><a name="a124738" id="a124738"></a> You register an instance of
this class by passing it as the argument to the <code>Sequencer
addMetaEventListener</code> method:</p>
<pre>
boolean b = sequencer.addMetaEventListener
        (myMetaListener);
</pre>
This is slightly different from the approach taken by the
<code>ControllerEventListener</code> interface, because you have to
register to receive all <code>MetaMessages,</code> not just
selected ones of interest. If the sequencer encounters a
<code>MetaMessage</code> in its sequence, it will invoke
<code>myMetaListener.meta</code>, passing it the
<code>MetaMessage</code> encountered. The <code>meta</code> method
can invoke <code>getType</code> on its <code>MetaMessage</code>
argument to obtain an integer from 0 to 127 that indicates the
message type, as defined by the Standard MIDI Files 1.0
specification.
