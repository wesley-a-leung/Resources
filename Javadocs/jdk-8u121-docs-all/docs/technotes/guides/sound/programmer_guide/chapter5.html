<h1>Chapter 5: Capturing Audio</h1>
<p><a name="a114180" id="a114180"></a> <em>Capturing</em> refers to
the process of obtaining a signal from outside the computer. A
common application of audio capture is recording, such as recording
the microphone input to a sound file. However, capturing isn't
synonymous with recording, because recording implies that the
application always saves the sound data that's coming in. An
application that captures audio doesn't necessarily store the
audio. Instead it might do something with the data as it's coming
in&mdash;such as transcribe speech into text&mdash;but then discard
each buffer of audio as soon as it's finished with that buffer.</p>
<p><a name="a114181" id="a114181"></a> As discussed in Chapter 2,
"<a href="chapter2.html">Overview of the Sampled Package</a>," a
typical audio-input system in an implementation of the Java Sound
API consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>An input port, such as a microphone port or a line-in port,
which feeds its incoming audio data into: <a name="a115691"></a></li>
<li>A mixer, which places the input data in: <a name="a115692"></a></li>
<li>One or more target data lines, from which an application can
retrieve the data.
<p><a name="a113956" id="a113956"></a> Commonly, only one input
port can be open at a time, but an audio-input mixer that mixes
audio from multiple ports is also possible. Another scenario
consists of a mixer that has no ports but instead gets its audio
input over a network.</p>
<p><a name="a113958" id="a113958"></a> The
<code>TargetDataLine</code> interface was introduced briefly under
"<a href="chapter2.html#a112445">The Line Interface Hierarchy</a>"
in Chapter 2, "<a href="chapter2.html">Overview of the Sampled
Package</a>." <code>TargetDataLine</code> is directly analogous to
the <code>SourceDataLine</code> interface, which was discussed
extensively in Chapter 4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing Back
Audio</a>." Recall that the <code>SourceDataLine</code> interface
consists of:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a113960" id=
"a113960"></a></li>
<li>A <code>write</code> method to send audio to the mixer <a name="a113961"></a></li>
<li>An <code>available</code> method to determine how much data can
be written to the buffer without blocking
<p><a name="a113963" id="a113963"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
Similarly, <code>TargetDataLine</code> consists of:
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><a name="a113965"></a></li>
<li>A <code>read</code> method to get audio from the mixer <a name="a113966"></a></li>
<li>An <code>available</code> method to determine how much data can
be read from the buffer without blocking</li>
</ul>
<a name="a113969" id="a113969"></a>
<h2>Setting Up a TargetDataLine</h2>
<p><a name="a113971" id="a113971"></a> The process of obtaining a
target data line was described in Chapter 3, "<a href=
"chapter3.html">Accessing Audio System Resources</a>," but we
repeat it here for convenience:</p>
<pre>
<code>TargetDataLine line;
</code><code>DataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(TargetDataLine.class, <br />    format); // format is an AudioFormat object
</code><code>if (!AudioSystem.isLineSupported(info)) {
</code><code>    // Handle the error ... 
</code><code>}
</code><code>// Obtain and open the line.
</code><code>try {<br />    line = (TargetDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(info);
</code><code>    line.open(format);
</code><code>} catch (LineUnavailableException ex) {
</code><code>    // Handle the error ... 
</code><code>}
</code><br /><a name="a113992" id="a113992"> </a>
</pre>
You could instead invoke <code>Mixer's</code> <code>getLine</code>
method, rather than <code>AudioSystem's</code>.
<p><a name="a113994" id="a113994"></a> As shown in this example,
once you've obtained a target data line, you reserve it for your
application's use by invoking the <code>DataLine</code> method
<code>open</code>, exactly as was described in the case of a source
data line in Chapter 4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing Back
Audio</a>." The single-parameter version of the <code>open</code>
method causes the line's buffer to have the default size. You can
instead set the buffer size according to your application's needs
by invoking the two-parameter version:</p>
<pre>
    void open(AudioFormat format, int bufferSize) 
</pre>
When choosing a buffer size, keep in mind the tradeoff between the
delays incurred by long buffers, on the one hand, and the risk of
discontinuities in the audio if the buffers are so short that you
can't retrieve the data fast enough, on the other hand. When
capturing audio, you risk data overflow if you don't pull data from
the filled buffers fast enough. If overflow occurs, some of the
captured data will be discarded, which will probably cause audible
clicks and skips in the sound. This is the opposite situation from
playback, where you risk data underflow, which can result in gaps
in the sound. (See Chapter 4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing Back
Audio</a>," for more on choosing buffer sizes.) <a name="a115741"></a>
<h2>Reading the Data from the TargetDataLine</h2>
<p><a name="a114004" id="a114004"></a> Once the line is open, it is
ready to start capturing data, but it isn't active yet. To actually
commence the audio capture, use the <code>DataLine</code> method
<code>start</code>. This begins delivering input audio data to the
line's buffer for your application to read. Your application should
invoke start only when it's ready to begin reading from the line;
otherwise a lot of processing is wasted on filling the capture
buffer, only to have it overflow (that is, discard data).</p>
<p><a name="a114006" id="a114006"></a> To start retrieving data
from the buffer, invoke <code>TargetDataLine's</code> read
method:</p>
<pre>
int read(byte[] b, int offset, int length) 
</pre>
This method attempts to read <code>length</code> bytes of data into
the array <code>b</code>, starting at the byte position
<code>offset</code> in the array. The method returns the number of
bytes actually read.
<p><a name="a114011" id="a114011"></a> As with
<code>SourceDataLine's write</code> method, you can request more
data than actually fits in the buffer, because the method blocks
until the requested amount of data has been delivered, even if you
request many buffers' worth of data.</p>
<p><a name="a115205" id="a115205"></a> To avoid having your
application hang during recording, you can invoke the read method
within a loop, until you've retrieved all the audio input, as in
this example:</p>
<pre>
// Assume that the TargetDataLine, line, has already
// been obtained and opened.
ByteArrayOutputStream out  = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
int numBytesRead;
byte[] data = new byte[line.getBufferSize() / 5];

// Begin audio capture.
line.start();

// Here, stopped is a global boolean set by another thread.
while (!stopped) {
   // Read the next chunk of data from the TargetDataLine.
   numBytesRead =  line.read(data, 0, data.length);
   // Save this chunk of data.
   out.write(data, 0, numBytesRead);
}     
</pre>
Notice that in this example, the size of the byte array into which
the data is read is set to be one-fifth the size of the line's
buffer. If you instead make it as big as the line's buffer and try
to read the entire buffer, you need to be very exact in your
timing, because data will be dumped if the mixer needs to deliver
data to the line while you are reading from it. By using some
fraction of the line's buffer size, as shown here, your application
will be more successful in sharing access to the line's buffer with
the mixer.
<p><a name="a114034" id="a114034"></a> The <code>read</code> method
of <code>TargetDataLine</code> takes three arguments: a byte array,
an offset into the array, and the number of bytes of input data
that you would like to read. In this example, the third argument is
simply the length of your byte array. The <code>read</code> method
returns the number of bytes that were actually read into your
array.</p>
<p><a name="a114036" id="a114036"></a> Typically, you read data
from the line in a loop, as in this example. Within the
<code>while</code> loop, each chunk of retrieved data is processed
in whatever way is appropriate for the application&mdash;here, it's
written to a <code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code>. Not shown here is
the use of a separate thread to set the boolean
<code>stopped</code>, which terminates the loop. This boolean's
value might be set to <code>true</code> when the user clicks a Stop
button, and also when a listener receives a <code>CLOSE</code> or
<code>STOP</code> event from the line. The listener is necessary
for <code>CLOSE</code> events and recommended for <code>STOP</code>
events. Otherwise, if the line gets stopped somehow without stopped
being set to <code>true</code>, the <code>while</code> loop will
capture zero bytes on each iteration, running fast and wasting CPU
cycles. A more thorough code example would show the loop being
re-entered if capture becomes active again.</p>
<p><a name="a114039" id="a114039"></a> As with a source data line,
it's possible to drain or flush a target data line. For example, if
you're recording the input to a file, you'll probably want to
invoke the <code>drain</code> method when the user clicks a Stop
button. The <code>drain</code> method will cause the mixer's
remaining data to get delivered to the target data line's buffer.
If you don't drain the data, the captured sound might seem to be
truncated prematurely at the end.</p>
<p><a name="a114041" id="a114041"></a> There might be some cases
where you instead want to flush the data. In any case, if you
neither flush nor drain the data, it will be left in the mixer.
This means that when capture recommences, there will be some
leftover sound at the beginning of the new recording, which might
be undesirable. It can be useful, then, to flush the target data
line before restarting the capture.</p>
<a name="a114432" id="a114432"></a>
<h2>Monitoring the Line's Status</h2>
<p><a name="a114046" id="a114046"></a> Because the
<code>TargetDataLine</code> interface extends
<code>DataLine</code>, target data lines generate events in the
same way source data lines do. You can register an object to
receive events whenever the target data line opens, closes, starts,
or stops. For more information, see "<a href=
"chapter4.html#a113711">Monitoring the Line's Status</a>" in Chapter
4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing Back Audio</a>."</p>
<a name="a114049" id="a114049"></a>
<h2>Processing the Incoming Audio</h2>
<p><a name="a114051" id="a114051"></a> Like some source data lines,
some mixers' target data lines have signal-processing controls,
such as gain, pan, reverb, or sample-rate controls. The input ports
might have similar controls, especially gain controls. For more
information on how to determine whether a line has such controls,
and how to use them if it does, see Chapter 6, "<a href=
"chapter6.html">Processing Audio with Controls</a>."</p>
