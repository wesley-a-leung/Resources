<h1>Chapter 15: Providing MIDI Services</h1>
<p><a name="a124027" id="a124027"></a> Chapter 13, "<a href=
"chapter13.html">Introduction to the Service Provider
Interfaces</a>," explained that the
<code>javax.sound.sampled.spi</code> and
<code>javax.sound.midi.spi</code> packages define abstract classes
to be used by developers of sound services. By implementing a
subclass of one of these abstract classes, a service provider can
create a new service that extends the functionality of the runtime
system. Chapter 14 covered the use of the
<code>javax.sound.sampled.spi</code> package. The present chapter
discusses how to use the <code>javax.sound.midi.spi</code> package
to provide new services for handling MIDI devices and files.</p>
<p><a name="a124023" id="a124023"></a> Applications programmers who
only use existing MIDI services in their programs can safely skip
this chapter. For an overview of MIDI and the use of the installed
MIDI services in an application program, see Part II, "MIDI," of
this Programmer's Guide. This chapter assumes that the reader is
familiar with the Java Sound API methods that application programs
invoke to access installed MIDI services.</p>
<a name="a122553" id="a122553"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a name="a122556" id="a122556"></a> There are four abstract
classes in the <code>javax.sound.midi.spi</code> package, which
represent four different types of services that you can provide for
the MIDI system:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a122558" id=
"a122558"></a></li>
<li><code>MidiFileWriter</code> provides MIDI file-writing
services. These services make it possible for an application
program to save, to a MIDI file, a MIDI <code>Sequence</code> that
it has generated or processed. <a name="a122559" id=
"a122559"></a></li>
<li><code>MidiFileReader</code> provides file-reading services that
return a MIDI <code>Sequence</code> from a MIDI file for use in an
application program. <a name="a122560" id="a122560"></a></li>
<li><code>MidiDeviceProvider</code> supplies instances of one or
more specific types of MIDI device, possibly including hardware
devices. <a name="a122561" id="a122561"></a></li>
<li><code>SoundbankReader</code> supplies soundbank file-reading
services. Concrete subclasses of <code>SoundbankReader</code> parse
a given soundbank file, producing a <code>Soundbank</code> object
that can be loaded into a <code>Synthesizer</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An application program will not directly create an instance of a
service object&mdash;whether a provider object, such as a
<code>MidiDeviceProvider</code>, or an object, such as a
<code>Synthesizer</code>, that is supplied by the provider object.
Nor will the program directly refer to the SPI classes. Instead,
the application program makes requests to the
<code>MidiSystem</code> object in the <code>javax.sound.midi</code>
package, and <code>MidiSystem</code> in turn uses concrete
subclasses of the <code>javax.sound.midi.spi</code> classes to
process these requests.</p>
<a name="a122566" id="a122566"></a>
<h2>Providing MIDI File-Writing Services</h2>
<p><a name="a122568" id="a122568"></a> There are three standard
MIDI file formats, all of which an implementation of the Java Sound
API can support: Type 0, Type 1, and Type 2. These file formats
differ in their internal representation of the MIDI sequence data
in the file, and are appropriate for different kinds of sequences.
If an implementation doesn't itself support all three types, a
service provider can supply the support for the unimplemented ones.
There are also variants of the standard MIDI file formats, some of
them proprietary, which similarly could be supported by a
third-party vendor.</p>
<p><a name="a124323" id="a124323"></a> The ability to write MIDI
files is provided by concrete subclasses of
<code>MidiFileWriter</code>. This abstract class is directly
analogous to <code>javax.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter</code>. Again,
the methods are grouped into query methods for learning what types
of files can be written, and methods for actually writing a file.
As with <code>AudioFileWriter</code>, two of the query methods are
concrete:</p>
<pre>
boolean isFileTypeSupported(int fileType)
boolean isFileTypeSupported(int fileType, Sequence sequence) 
</pre>
The first of these provides general information about whether the
file writer can ever write the specified type of MIDI file type.
The second method is more specific: it asks whether a particular
Sequence can be written to the specified type of MIDI file.
Generally, you don't need to override either of these two concrete
methods. In the default implementation, each invokes one of two
other corresponding query methods and iterates over the results
returned. Being abstract, these other two query methods need to be
implemented in the subclass:
<pre>
abstract int[] getMidiFileTypes() 
abstract int[] getMidiFileTypes(Sequence sequence) 
</pre>
The first of these returns an array of all the file types that are
supported in general. A typical implementation might initialize the
array in the file writer's constructor and return the array from
this method. From that set of file types, the second method finds
the subset to which the file writer can write the given Sequence.
In accordance with the MIDI specification, not all types of
sequences can be written to all types of MIDI files.
<p><a name="a122590" id="a122590"></a> The <code>write</code>
methods of a <code>MidiFileWriter</code> subclass perform the
encoding of the data in a given <code>Sequence</code> into the
correct data format for the requested type of MIDI file, writing
the coded stream to either a file or an output stream:</p>
<pre>
abstract int write(Sequence in, int fileType, 
                   java.io.File out) 
abstract int write(Sequence in, int fileType, 
                   java.io.OutputStream out) 
</pre>
To do this, the <code>write</code> method must parse the
<code>Sequence</code> by iterating over its tracks, construct an
appropriate file header, and write the header and tracks to the
output. The MIDI file's header format is, of course, defined by the
MIDI specification. It includes such information as a "magic
number" identifying this as a MIDI file, the header's length, the
number of tracks, and the sequence's timing information (division
type and resolution). The rest of the MIDI file consists of the
track data, in the format defined by the MIDI specification.
<p><a name="a124482" id="a124482"></a> Let's briefly look at how
the application program, MIDI system, and service provider
cooperate in writing a MIDI file. In a typical situation, an
application program has a particular MIDI <code>Sequence</code> to
save to a file. The program queries the <code>MidiSystem</code>
object to see what MIDI file formats, if any, are supported for the
particular <code>Sequence</code> at hand, before attempting to
write the file. The
<code>MidiSystem.getMidiFileTypes(Sequence)</code> method returns
an array of all the MIDI file types to which the system can write a
particular sequence. It does this by invoking the corresponding
<code>getMidiFileTypes</code> method for each of the installed
<code>MidiFileWriter</code> services, and collecting and returning
the results in an array of integers that can be thought of as a
master list of all file types compatible with the given
<code>Sequence</code>. When it comes to writing the
<code>Sequence</code> to a file, the call to
<code>MidiSystem.write</code> is passed an integer representing a
file type, along with the <code>Sequence</code> to be written and
the output file; <code>MidiSystem</code> uses the supplied type to
decide which installed <code>MidiFileWriter</code> should handle
the write request, and dispatches a corresponding
<code>write</code> to the appropriate
<code>MidiFileWriter</code>.</p>
<a name="a122592" id="a122592"></a>
<h2>Providing MIDI File-Reading Services</h2>
<p><a name="a124559" id="a124559"></a> The
<code>MidiFileReader</code> abstract class is directly analogous to
<code>javax.sampled.spi.AudioFileReader</code> class. Both consist
of two overloaded methods, each of which can take a
<code>File</code>, <code>URL</code>, or <code>InputStream</code>
argument. The first of the overloaded methods returns the file
format of a specified file. In the case of
<code>MidiFileReader</code>, the API is:</p>
<pre>
abstract MidiFileFormat getMidiFileFormat(java.io.File file) 
abstract MidiFileFormat getMidiFileFormat(
    java.io.InputStream stream) 
abstract MidiFileFormat getMidiFileFormat(java.net.URL url) 
</pre>
Concrete subclasses must implement these methods to return a
filled-out <code>MidiFileFormat</code> object describing the format
of the specified MIDI file (or stream or URL), assuming that the
file is of a type supported by the file reader and that it contains
valid header information. Otherwise, an
<code>InvalidMidiDataException</code> should be thrown.
<p><a name="a124619" id="a124619"></a> The other overloaded method
returns a MIDI <code>Sequence</code> from a given file, stream, or
URL :</p>
<pre>
abstract Sequence getSequence(java.io.File file) 
abstract Sequence getSequence(java.io.InputStream stream) 
abstract Sequence getSequence(java.net.URL url) 
</pre>
The <code>getSequence</code> method performs the actual work of
parsing the bytes in the MIDI input file and constructing a
corresponding <code>Sequence</code> object. This is essentially the
inverse of the process used by <code>MidiFileWriter.write</code>.
Because there is a one-to-one correspondence between the contents
of a MIDI file as defined by the MIDI specification and a
<code>Sequence</code> object as defined by the Java Sound API, the
details of the parsing are straightforward. If the file passed to
<code>getSequence</code> contains data that the file reader can't
parse (for example, because the file has been corrupted or doesn't
conform to the MIDI specification), an
<code>InvalidMidiDataException</code> should be thrown. <a name="a122598"></a>
<h2>Providing Particular MIDI Devices</h2>
<p><a name="a124755" id="a124755"></a> A
<code>MidiDeviceProvider</code> can be considered a factory that
supplies one or more particular types of MIDI device. The class
consists of a method that returns an instance of a MIDI device, as
well as query methods to learn what kinds of devices this provider
can supply.</p>
<p><a name="a124728" id="a124728"></a> As with the other
<code>javax.sound.midi.spi</code> services, application developers
get indirect access to a <code>MidiDeviceProvider</code> service
through a call to <code>MidiSystem</code> methods, in this case
<code>MidiSystem.getMidiDevice</code> and
<code>MidiSystem.getMidiDeviceInfo</code>. The purpose of
subclassing <code>MidiDeviceProvider</code> is to supply a new kind
of device, so the service developer must also create an
accompanying class for the device being returned&mdash;just as we
saw with <code>MixerProvider</code> in the
<code>javax.sound.sampled.spi</code> package. There, the returned
device's class implemented the
<code>javax.sound.sampled.Mixer</code> interface; here it
implements the <code>javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice</code> interface.
It might also implement a subinterface of <code>MidiDevice</code>,
such as <code>Synthesizer</code> or <code>Sequencer</code>.</p>
<p><a name="a124812" id="a124812"></a> Because a single subclass of
<code>MidiDeviceProvider</code> can provide more than one type of
<code>MidiDevice</code>, the <code>getDeviceInfo</code> method of
the class returns an array of <code>MidiDevice.Info</code> objects
enumerating the different <code>MidiDevices</code> available:</p>
<pre>
abstract MidiDevice.Info[] getDeviceInfo() 
</pre>
<p>The returned array can contain a single element, of course. A
typical implementation of the provider might initialize an array in
its constructor and return it here. This allows
<code>MidiSystem</code> to iterate over all installed
<code>MidiDeviceProviders</code> to construct a list of all
installed devices. <code>MidiSystem</code> can then return this
list (<code>MidiDevice.Info[]</code> array) to an application
program.</p>
<p><a name="a124843" id="a124843"></a>
<code>MidiDeviceProvider</code> also includes a concrete query
method:</p>
<pre>
boolean isDeviceSupported(MidiDevice.Info info) 
</pre>
This method permits the system to query the provider about a
specific kind of device. Generally, you don't need to override this
convenience method. The default implementation iterates over the
array returned by getDeviceInfo and compares the argument to each
element.
<p><a name="a124862" id="a124862"></a> The third and final
<code>MidiDeviceProvider</code> method returns the requested
device:</p>
<pre>
abstract MidiDevice getDevice(MidiDevice.Info info) 
</pre>
This method should first test the argument to make sure it
describes a device that this provider can supply. If it doesn't, it
should throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>. Otherwise,
it returns the device. <a name="a122605" id="a122605"></a>
<h2>Providing Soundbank File-Reading Services</h2>
<p><a name="a122607" id="a122607"></a> A <code>SoundBank</code> is
a set of <code>Instruments</code> that can be loaded into a
<code>Synthesizer</code>. An <code>Instrument</code> is an
implementation of a sound-synthesis algorithm that produces a
particular sort of sound, and includes accompanying name and
information strings. A <code>SoundBank</code> roughly corresponds
to a bank in the MIDI specification, but it's a more extensive and
addressable collection; it can perhaps better be thought of as a
collection of MIDI banks. (For more background information on
<code>SoundBanks</code> and <code>Synthesizers</code>, see Chapter
12, "<a href="chapter12.html">Synthesizing Sound</a>.")</p>
<p><a name="a122609" id="a122609"></a> <code>SoundbankReader</code>
consists of a single overloaded method, which the system invokes to
read a <code>Soundbank</code> object from a soundbank file:</p>
<pre>
abstract Soundbank getSoundbank(java.io.File file) 
abstract Soundbank getSoundbank(java.io.InputStream stream) 
abstract Soundbank getSoundbank(java.net.URL url) 
</pre>
<p>Concrete subclasses of <code>SoundbankReader</code> will work in
tandem with particular provider-defined implementations of
<code>SoundBank</code>, <code>Instrument</code>, and
<code>Synthesizer</code> to allow the system to load a
<code>SoundBank</code> from a file into an instance of a particular
<code>Synthesizer</code> class. Synthesis techniques may differ
wildly from one <code>Synthesizer</code> to another, and, as a
consequence, the data stored in an <code>Instrument</code> or
<code>SoundBank</code> providing control or specification data for
the synthesis process of a <code>Synthesizer</code> can take a
variety of forms. One synthesis technique may require only a few
bytes of parameter data; another may be based on extensive sound
samples. The resources present in a <code>SoundBank</code> will
depend upon the nature of the <code>Synthesizer</code> into which
they get loaded, and therefore the implementation of the
<code>getSoundbank</code> method of a <code>SoundbankReader</code>
subclass has access to knowledge of a particular kind of
<code>SoundBank</code>. In addition, a particular subclass of
<code>SoundbankReader</code> understands a particular file format
for storing the <code>SoundBank</code> data. That file format may
be vendor-specific and proprietary.</p>
<p><a name="a124966" id="a124966"></a> <code>SoundBank</code> is
just an interface, with only weak constraints on the contents of a
<code>SoundBank</code> object. The methods an object must support
to implement this interface (<code>getResources</code>,
<code>getInstruments</code>, <code>getVendor</code>,
<code>getName</code>, etc.) impose loose requirements on the data
that the object contains. For example, <code>getResources</code>
and <code>getInstruments</code> can return empty arrays. The actual
contents of a subclassed <code>SoundBank</code> object, in
particular its instruments and its non-instrument resources, are
defined by the service provider. Thus, the mechanism of parsing a
soundbank file depends entirely on the specification of that
particular kind of soundbank file.</p>
<p><a name="a122614" id="a122614"></a> Soundbank files are created
outside the Java Sound API, typically by the vendor of the
synthesizer that can load that kind of soundbank. Some vendors
might supply end-user tools for creating such files.</p>
