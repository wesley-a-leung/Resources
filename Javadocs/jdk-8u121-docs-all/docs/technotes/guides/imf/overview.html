Introduction</h2>
<p>Input methods are software components that interpret user
operations such as typing keys, speaking, or writing using a pen
device to generate text input for applications. The most common
input methods are the ones that let users type text in Chinese,
Japanese, or Korean, languages that use thousands of different
characters, on a regular-sized keyboard. The text is typed in a
form that can be handled by regular-sized keyboards, for example,
in a romanized form, and then converted into the form that's really
intended. Typically a sequence of several characters needs to be
typed and then converted in one chunk, and conversion may have to
be retried because there may be several possible translations.
Similarly, for hand-writing recognition, the user may write a
series of characters, convert them, and select the correct text
from several possible conversion results. This process is called
<em>composition</em>, and the text that the input method is working
on is called <em>composed text</em>. It ends when the user confirms
the final conversion result and the text is <em>committed</em>.</p>
<p>During composition, the composed text logically belongs to the
input method, but still needs to be displayed to the user. Input
method frameworks cooperate with input methods to provide at least
two ways to do this: They enable modern text editing components to
display the text in the context of the document that it will
eventually belong to, albeit in a style that indicates that the
text still needs to be converted or confirmed by the input method.
This is called <em>on-the-spot</em> style input. And they provide a
separate window to display the text as a fall-back if a
not-so-modern text editing component can't deal with the text until
it's confirmed. We call this <em>root-window</em> style input.</p>
<p>The input method framework enables the
collaboration between text editing components and input methods in
entering text. Its input method client API provides interfaces and
classes that enable text editing components to communicate with
input methods and implement a well-integrated text input user
interface in the on-the-spot and below-the-spot styles; it also
provides root-window style input as a fallback. Its service
provider interface (SPI) for input method engines provides
interfaces that enable the development of input methods in the Java
programming language that can be used with any Java runtime
environment; it also supports native input methods of the host
platform.</p>

<h2><a name="Goals" id="Goals"></a>2. Goals</h2>
<h3>"Write Once, Run Anywhere in the World" for Text
Components</h3>
<p>Text editing components that use the input method framework run
on any Java application environment and support any text input
methods available on that Java application environment without
modifying or recompiling the text editing component. The framework
isolates text editing components from differences in platforms and
input method engines. It provides only one programming model for
interacting with input methods. This lets developers write to a
single API, and lets users choose whatever input method they
prefer. When using native input methods, the framework maps to the
platform input method APIs.</p>
<p>Although engine independence will be important to most
developers, some high-end developers may want access to engine
specific features. The framework allows this access.</p>
<h3>"Write Once, Run Anywhere in the World" for Input Methods</h3>
<p>Input methods written in the Java programming language and using
the input method engine SPI can be installed into any Java
application environment and support any text component running in
that Java application environment. The framework isolates input
methods from differences in platforms and text editing components.
It provides only one programming model for interacting with text
components. This lets developers write to a single SPI, and lets
users choose whatever text editing component they prefer.</p>
<h3>Language Independence</h3>
<p>The input method framework is language independent in order to
satisfy the needs of fully international applications. Although
input methods are generally used for entering East Asian text, they
may be useful for other languages as well. For example, a
transliteration input method might be developed to allow Greek to
be entered using Latin characters.</p>
<p>The framework handles input methods for different languages at
the same time for truly multilingual text editing. While the choice
of native input methods may be limited by the host operating
system, any input method written in the Java programming language
and using the input method engine SPI can be used at any time. Text
created by an input method can have language attributes so that
applications can perform language sensitive operations on the
text.</p>
<h3>Input Device Independence</h3>
<p>The input method framework is designed to accommodate many
possible input devices. Although keyboards are the predominant way
of entering text today, other devices are gaining importance. For
some platforms, pen-based input is the only way to enter text.
Also, voice input is becoming more and more popular. The input
method engine SPI opens the way to support these alternate
devices.</p>
<h3>Multiple Service Levels</h3>
<p>Different programs have different needs for input method
support. Tight integration with input methods provides the best
user interface, but requires some additional programming. Some
developers may not find that additional work worthwhile, but their
applications still need to be able to receive East Asian text
input. A few programs, such as games, want direct low-level
keyboard input without interference from an input method. The
framework lets programs choose one of the following levels of text
input support.</p>
<h4>Integrated Text Input User Interface</h4>
<p>Modern programs intended to be used with East Asian languages
usually provide a fully integrated user interface for text input
operations and show the text being composed embedded in the
document text. While converting text, the current candidate is
highlighted, and when the user chooses a different candidate, the
previous candidate text is replaced with the new one. This user
interface support for input methods is known as
<em>on-the-spot</em> style (or <em>inline</em> style). An
alternative that Chinese-speaking users often prefer is the
<em>below-the-spot</em> style, where composed text is shown in a
separate composition window that is automatically positioned close
to the insertion point where text will be inserted after being
committed. The input method client API lets text editing components
implement these integrated text input user interfaces.</p>
<p>Integration does not only mean displaying the composed text in
the context of the target document. It also means that the text
editing component understands "input method events", which let the
input method communicate more information about the text than
simple key events (for example, grammatical information), and that
it can responds to requests for information from the input method
that let the input method improve its functionality (for example,
its accuracy).</p>
<h4>Non-Integrated Text Input User Interface</h4>
<p>For programs that do not want to deal with the user interface
for text input operations, only final input text is sent to the
application. In this case, the framework provides a user interface
for input operations in a separate composition window outside the
application. This is known as <i>root-window</i> style. It is less
convenient because the user either has to manually position the
window near the insertion point or to move his/her eyes between the
composition window and the application window.</p>
<p>In this case, the application receives the input text as a
sequence of key events. Therefore, there is no way to receive any
information associated with the input text, such as grammatical
information. Also, surrogate pairs (as defined in the Unicode
Standard, version 2.0) are received as two separate key events.</p>
<h4>No Input Method Support</h4>
<p>Some applications, such as game software, may need only raw key
input and no input method support. The framework provides a way to
explicitly disable input method support.</p>
<h3>Building Block Reuse</h3>
<p>An important theme of object-oriented programming is reuse of
program building blocks. The same building block may be used in
many different applications, and several times within the same
application. To make it easy to combine different text editing
building blocks of possibly different capabilities, the input
method framework interacts with each text editing component
directly and individually.</p>
<p>As a consequence, many applications will not interact with the
input method framework directly at all. Instead, they will use
ready-made text editing components, such as the Swing text
components, which will handle the interaction for them.</p>
<h3>Close Integration with Other Frameworks</h3>
<p>The input method framework is designed as an integral part of
the Java platform. Interfaces that are necessary to exchange text
between input methods and text components are designed to also
support communication between other text-related frameworks, such
as Java 2D and the Swing text components. Support for input method
highlight drawing is integrated into Java 2D, so that text
components can treat composed text just like any other text and the
highlights just like any other style. Java 2D interacts with the
input method framework to determine appropriate visual styles for
input method highlights depending on the platform. The Swing text
components use the input method framework to implement the best
possible user interface with minimal additional programming.</p>

<h2><a name="Input__Method__Support__in__Other__Frameworks" id=
"Input__Method__Support__in__Other__Frameworks"></a>3. Input Method
Support in Other Frameworks</h2>
<p>This chapter summarizes functionality in other Java platform
frameworks that support input methods.</p>
<h3>Text</h3>
<p>The <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/text/AttributedCharacterIterator.html">AttributedCharacterIterator</a></code>
interface provides a standard way of communicating text information
with attributes between frameworks. It lets text readers access
text without having to know how the text is stored in the
information provider. Attribute information may include font and
style attributes as well as language tags and grammatical
annotations.</p>
<h3>Abstract Window Toolkit</h3>
<p>The <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/Window.html">Window</a></code> class creates
an initial input context for the window, and disposes this input
context for the window when the window is disposed. Explicitly
disposing input contexts allows to free up the (often substantial)
resources allocated by native input methods.</p>
<p>The <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/Component.html">Component</a></code> class
has methods to handle input contexts and input method request
handlers. Newly created <code>Component</code> instances other than
windows initially share the input context of their containing
window. The event handling in the <code>Component</code> class
redirects incoming events to the input context associated with the
component, and only passes them on to the component's listeners if
they have not been consumed by an input method. Focus changes are
communicated to the input context so it can activate or deactivate
input methods.</p>
<p>The AWT classes that have knowledge of event or listener classes
handle the <code>InputMethodEvent</code> and
<code>InputMethodListener</code> classes.</p>
<p>The <code>Graphics</code> class defines a <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/Graphics.html#drawString-java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator-int-int-">
drawString</a></code> method that accepts
<code>AttributedCharacterIterator</code> instances as input.
Instances of the <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/font/TextLayout.html">TextLayout</a></code>
class can be constructed from
<code>AttributedCharacterIterator</code> instances and used to draw
text with input method highlights. Both ways of drawing text
recognize input method highlights as attributes of the text and
render them.</p>
<h3>Swing</h3>
<p>The <a href=
"../../../api/javax/swing/text/JTextComponent.html">Swing text
components</a> are by default active clients
of the input method framework. That means, applications using these
text components will use on-the-spot or below-the-spot style input
by default. Application developers are still responsible for
<a href="api-tutorial.html#Ending__Input__Operations">ending
input operations</a> when some other operation is started that
requires the text to be committed. They may also use the input
method framework's methods to <a href=
"api-tutorial.html#Creating__Private__Input__Contexts">create a
private input context</a>, to <a href=
"api-tutorial.html#Selecting__Input__Methods">select an input
