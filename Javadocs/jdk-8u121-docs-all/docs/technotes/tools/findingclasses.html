<h2>How the Java Launcher Finds Classes</h2>
<p>The Java launcher, <b>java</b>, initiates the Java virtual
machine. The virtual machine searches for and loads classes in this
order:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bootstrap classes</b> - Classes that comprise the Java
platform, including the classes in <code>rt.jar</code> and several
other important jar files.</li>
<li><b>Extension classes</b> - Classes that use the Java Extension
mechanism. These are bundled as <code>.jar</code> files located in
the extensions directory.</li>
<li><b>User classes</b> - Classes defined by developers and third
parties that do not take advantage of the extension mechanism. You
identify the location of these classes using the
<tt>-classpath</tt> option on the command line (the preferred
method) or by using the CLASSPATH environment variable. (See
<b>Setting the Classpath</b> for <a href=
"windows/classpath.html">Windows</a> or <a href=
"unix/classpath.html">Unix</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In effect, these three search paths are joined to form a simple
class path. This is similar to the "flat" class path previously
used, but the current model has some important differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is relatively difficult to accidentally "hide" or omit the
bootstrap classes.</li>
<li>In general, you only have to specify the location of user
classes. Bootstrap classes and extension classes are found
"automatically".</li>
<li>The tools classes are now in a separate archive
(<tt>tools.jar</tt>) and can only be used if included in the user
class path (to be explained shortly).</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="bootclass" id="bootclass"></a></p>
<h3>How the Java Launcher Finds Bootstrap Classes</h3>
<p>Bootstrap classes are the classes that implement the Java 2
Platform. Bootstrap classes are in the <code>rt.jar</code> and
several other jar files in the <code>jre/lib</code> directory.
These archives are specified by the value of the bootstrap class
path which is stored in the <code>sun.boot.class.path</code> system
property. This system property is for reference only, and should
not be directly modified.</p>
<p>It is very unlikely that you will need to redefine the bootstrap
class path. The nonstandard option, <b>-Xbootclasspath</b>, allows
you to do so in those rare cicrcumstances in which it is necessary
to use a different set of core classes.</p>
<p>Note that the classes which implement the Java 2 SDK tools are
in a separate archive from the bootstrap classes. The tools archive
is the SDK's<code>/lib/tools.jar</code> file. The development tools
add this archive to the user class path when invoking the launcher.
However, this augmented user class path is only used to execute the
tool. The tools that process source code, <b>javac</b> and
<b>javadoc</b>, use the original class path, not the augmented
version. (For more information, see <a href="#srcfiles">How Javac
and Javadoc Find Classes</a>, below.)</p>
<p><a name="extclass" id="extclass"></a></p>
<h3>How the Java Launcher Finds Extension Classes</h3>
<p>Extension classes are classes which extend the Java platform.
Every <code>.jar</code> file in the extension directory,
<tt>jre/lib/ext</tt>, is assumed to be an extension and is loaded
using the <a href="../guides/extensions/index.html">Java Extension
Framework</a>. Loose class files in the extension directory will
not be found. They must be contained in a <tt>.jar</tt> file (or
<tt>.zip</tt> file). There is no option provided for changing the
location of the extension directory.<br /></p>
<p>If the <tt>jre/lib/ext</tt> directory contains multiple
<code>.jar</code> files, and those files contain classes with the
same name, such as:</p>
<p><code>smart-extension1_0.jar contains class
smart.extension.Smart<br />
smart-extension1_1.jar contains class
smart.extension.Smart<br /></code></p>
<p>the class that actually gets loaded is undefined.</p>
<p><a name="userclass" id="userclass"></a></p>
<h3>How the Java Launcher Finds User Classes</h3>
<p>User classes are classes which build on the Java platform. To
find user classes, the launcher refers to the <i>user class
path</i> -- a list of directories, JAR archives, and ZIP archives
which contain class files.</p>
<p>A class file has a subpath name that reflects the class's
fully-qualified name. For example, if the class
<code>com.mypackage.MyClass</code> is stored under
<code>/myclasses</code>, then <code>/myclasses</code> must be in
the user class path and the full path to the class file must be
/<code>myclasses/com/mypackage/MyClass.class</code>. If the class
is stored in an archive named <code>myclasses.jar</code>, then
<code>myclasses.jar</code> must be in the user class path, and the
class file must be stored in the archive as
<code>com/mypackage/MyClass.class</code>.</p>
<p>The user class path is specified as a string, with a colon
(<b><code>:</code></b>) separating the class path entries on
Solaris, and a semi-colon (<b><code>;</code></b>) separating
entries on Microsoft Windows systems. The <b>java</b> launcher puts
the user class path string in the <code>java.class.path</code>
system property. The possible sources of this value are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The default value, "<b><code>.</code></b>", meaning that user
class files are all the class files in the current directory (or
under it, if in a package).</li>
<li>The value of the <b>CLASSPATH</b> environment variable, which
overrides the default value.</li>
<li>The value of the <b>-cp</b> or <b>-classpath</b> command line
option, which overrides both the default value and the
<b>CLASSPATH</b> value.</li>
<li>The JAR archive specified by the <b>-jar</b> option, which
overrides all other values. If this option is used, all user
classes must come from the specified archive.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="jarclass" id="jarclass"></a></p>
<h3>How the Java Launcher Finds JAR-class-path Classes</h3>
<p>A JAR file usually contains a "manifest" -- a file which lists
the contents of the JAR. The manifest can define a JAR-class-path,
which further extends the class path (but only while loading
classes from that JAR). Classes accessed by a JAR-class-path are
found in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, classes referenced by a JAR-class-path entry are
found as though they were part of the JAR file. The JAR files that
appear in the JAR-class-path are searched after any earlier class
path entries, and before any entries that appear later in the class
path.</li>
<li>However, if the JAR-class-path points to a JAR file that was
already searched (for example, an extension, or a JAR file that was
listed earlier in the class path) then that JAR file will not be
searched again. (This optimization improves efficiency and prevents
circular searches.) Such a JAR file is searched at the point that
it appears, earlier in the class path.</li>
<li>If a JAR file is installed as an extension, then any
JAR-class-path it defines is ignored. All the classes required by
an extension are presumed to be part of the SDK or to have
themselves been installed as extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="srcfiles" id="srcfiles"></a></p>
<h2>How Javac and JavaDoc Find Classes</h2>
<p>The <b>javac</b> and <b>javadoc</b> tools use class files in two
distinct ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like any Java application, <b>javac</b> and <b>javadoc</b> must
load various class files in order to run.</li>
<li>To process the source code they operate on, <b>javac</b> and
<b>javadoc</b> must obtain information on object types used in the
source code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The class files used to resolve source code references are
mostly the same class files used to run <b>javac</b> and
<b>javadoc</b>. But there are some important exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both <b>javac</b> and <b>javadoc</b> often resolve references
to classes and interfaces that having nothing to do with the
implementation of <b>javac</b> or <b>javadoc</b>. Information on
referenced user classes and interfaces may be present in the form
of class files, source code files, or both.</li>
<li>The tools classes in <code>tools.jar</code> are only used to
run <b>javac</b> and <b>javadoc</b>. The tools classes are not used
to resolve source code references unless <code>tools.jar</code> is
in the user class path.</li>
<li>A programmer may want to resolve boot class or extension class
references using an alternative Java platform implementation. Both
<b>javac</b> and <b>javadoc</b> support this with their
<b>-bootclasspath</b> and <b>-extdirs</b> options. Use of these
options does not modify the set of class files used to run the
<b>javac</b> or <b>javadoc</b> tools themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a referenced class is defined in both a class file and source
file, <b>javadoc</b> always uses the source file (javadoc never
compiles source files). In the same situation <b>javac</b> uses
class files, but automatically recompiles any class files it
determines to be out of date. The rules for automatic recompilation
are documented in the <b>javac</b> document for <a href=
"windows/javac.html">Windows</a> or <a href=
"unix/javac.html">Unix</a>.</p>
<p>By default, <b>javac</b> and <b>javadoc</b> search the user
class path for both class files and source code files. If the
<b>-sourcepath</b> option is specified, <b>javac</b> and
<b>javadoc</b> search for source files only on the specified source
file path, while still searching the user class path for class
files.</p>
<p><a name="loader" id="loader"></a></p>
<h2>Class Loading and Security Policies</h2>
<p>To be used, a class or interface must be loaded by a class
loader. Use of a particular class loader determines a security
policy associated with the class loader.</p>
<p>A program can load a class or interface by calling the
<b>loadClass</b> method of a class loader object. But usually a
program loads a class or interface simply by referring to it. This
invokes an internal class loader, which can apply a security policy
to extension and user classes. If the security policy has not been
enabled, all classes are "trusted". Even if the security policy is
enabled, it does not apply to bootstrap classes, which are always
"trusted."</p>
<p>When enabled, security policy is configured by system and user
policy files. The Java 2 SDK includes a system policy file that
grants "trusted" status to extension classes and places basic
restrictions on user classes.</p>
<p>To enable or configure the security policy, refer to <a href=
"../guides/security/index.html">Security Features</a>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Some security programming techniques that worked
with the Java 1.1 platform are incompatible with the class loading
model of the Java 2 Platform.</p>
